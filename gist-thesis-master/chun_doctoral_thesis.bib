Non-emitting events occurring during a restricted period are never suspected by a distant observer. The cloak works by locally manipulating the speed of light of an initially uniform light distribution, whilst the light rays themselves always follow straight paths. Any 'perfect' spacetime cloak would necessarily rely upon the technology of electromagnetic metamaterials, which has already been shown to be capable of deforming light in ways hitherto unforeseen—to produce, for example, an electromagnetic object cloak. Nevertheless, we show how it is possible to use intensity-dependent refractive indices to construct an approximate {STC}, an implementation that would enable the distinct signature of successful event cloaking to be observed. Potential demonstrations include systems that apparently violate quantum statistics, 'interrupt-without-interrupt' computation on convergent data channels and the illusion of a Star Trek transporter.},

Unfortunately, given the computational demands of full 3-D simulations, researchers can seldom bring this modeling tool to bear on more than a few isolated design points. Thus 3-D {FDTD} -- as it stands now -- is merely a verification rather than a design optimization tool. Over the long term, continuing improvements in available computing power can be expected to bring structures of current interest within general reach. In the meantime, however, many researchers appear to be exploring alternative modeling techniques, trading off flexibility of approach in return for more rapid turnaround on the devices of specific interest to them. In contrast, we are trying to improve the efficiency of 3-D {FDTD} by reducing its computational expense without sacrificing accuracy. We believe that these two approaches are completely complementary because even with vast amounts of computational power, any real-world system will still require a modular approach to modeling, spanning from the nanometer to the millimeter scale or beyond.},

Such perturbations include elipticity and uniform scaling of a fiber cross section, as well as changes in the horizontal or vertical sizes of a planar waveguide. Our theory is valid even for discontinuous high-index contrast variations of the refractive index across a waveguide cross section. We establish that, if at some frequencies a particular mode behaves like pure {TE} or {TM} polarized mode (polarization is judged by the relative amounts of the electric and magnetic longitudinal energies in the waveguide cross section), then at such frequencies for fibers under elliptical deformation its {PMD} as defined by an intermode dispersion parameter τ becomes proportional to group-velocity dispersion D such that τ=λδ{\textbar}D{\textbar}, where δ is a measure of the fiber elipticity and λ is a wavelength of operation. As an example, we investigate a relation between {PMD} and group-velocity dispersion of a multiple-core step-index fiber as a function of the core–clad index contrast. We establish that in this case the positions of the maximum {PMD} and maximum absolute value of group-velocity dispersion are strongly correlated, with the ratio of {PMD} to group-velocity dispersion being proportional to the core–clad dielectric contrast.},

Different heuristics, which are used by the algorithms to guide them to the goal node, are presented and compared. To overcome some of the computational constraints associated with route finding on large digital terrains we introduce multi-resolution searching.

The macroscopic configuration of meta-material simulated in {FDTD} was a slab of finite thickness. A genuine plane wave normally incident on the slab was simulated by {FDTD} and the phase of the total field was extracted with an optimized phase extraction technique. The phase of the total field was verified to vary monotonously along the center of the slab. According to this property, the wavelength, the phase velocity and refraction index of the electromagnetic wave in the meta-material were readily determined. As comparison to our method, the conventional method to determine refraction index with Snell's law was also performed. The results of our method and the conventional method are in good agreement. But our novel method cut down the computational domain more than 30 times and greatly save the computation time.},

	abstract = {We have developed an algorithm for evaluating the accuracy and reliability of photonic crystal {(PhC)} simulations, and used it to analyze the influence of excitation and detector placement in finite-difference time-domain algorithm {(FDTD)} simulations of two canonical {PhC} systems. In order to perform this computationally expensive analysis, we evaluated the use of filter diagonalization as an alternative to the Fourier Transform for mode detection, and developed a parallelization algorithm to take advantage of the inherent concurrency in simulating periodic systems. A map of locations where mode detection fails was generated, and we show that this is equivalent to a map of the node densities of the system. In addition to the expected high nodal densities at the symmetry areas of each system, we find more difficult to characterize patterns of high nodal density for the higher-order modes. Based on the observed behavior we are able to provide concrete rules to optimize the detection and excitation of modes in {FDTD} simulations of {PhC} systems. Although {PhCs} were studied, the presented strategies and results apply to the much broader class of all computational time-domain problems where Bloch-Floquet boundary conditions are used.

They then investigate the unique phenomena that take place within photonic crystals at defect sites and surfaces, from one to three dimensions. This new edition includes entirely new chapters describing important hybrid structures that use band gaps or periodicity only in some directions: periodic waveguides, photonic-crystal slabs, and photonic-crystal fibers. The authors demonstrate how the capabilities of photonic crystals to localize light can be put to work in devices such as filters and splitters. A new appendix provides an overview of computational methods for electromagnetism.

Specifically, this spectroscopic technique extracts the real and imaginary indices of the organic layer for each wavelength of interest. The {SPRS} sensitivity was calculated for several device architectures, metals, and layer thicknesses to optimize the organic film absorptivity measurements. Distinct optical absorption features were clearly observed for {R6G} layers as thin as a single molecular monolayer between two metal electrodes. This method also enables dynamic measurement of molecular conformation inside metallic junctions, as shown by following the optical switching of a thin spiropyran/polymer film upon exposure to {UV} light. Finally, optical and electrical measurements can be made simultaneously to study the effect of electrical bias and current on molecular conformation, which may have significant impact in areas such as molecular and organic electronics.},

Since the {PGY} algorithm is an explicit method, it has a high degree of parallelism. To this end, a highly scalable parallel algorithm based on a spatial decomposition of the general unstructured mesh is presented. Two spatial decompositions are compared, the recursive inertia partitioning {(RIP)} algorithm and the Greedy algorithm. The Greedy algorithm provides optimal load balance, whereas the {RIP} algorithm more effectively minimizes shared boundary interface lengths. Through numerical examples, It is demostrated that the Greedy algorithm provides superior speedups. It is also demonstrated that the parallel {PGY} algorithm is a highly scalable algorithm.},

This formulation, called the on-surface radiation condition {(OSRC)} approach, is based upon an expansion of the radiation condition applied directly on the surface of a scatterer. Past approaches involved applying a radiation condition at some distance from the scatterer in order to achieve a nearly reflection-free truncation of a finite-difference time-domain lattice. However, it is now shown that application of a suitable radiation condition directly on the surface of a convex conducting scatterer can lead to substantial simplification of the frequency-domain integral equation for the scattered field, which is reduced to just a line integral. For the transverse magnetic {(TM)} case, the integrand is known explicitly. For the transverse electric {(TE)} case, the integrand can be easily constructed by solving an ordinary differential equation around the scatterer surface contour. Examples are provided which show that {OSRC} yields computed near and far fields which approach the exact results for canonical shapes such as the circular cylinder, square cylinder, and strip. Electrical sizes for the examples areka = 5andka = 10. The new {OSRC} formulation of scattering may present a useful alternative to present integral equation and uniform high-frequency approaches for convex cylinders larger thanka = 1. Structures with edges or corners can also be analyzed, although more work is needed to incorporate the physics of singular currents at these discontinuities. Convex dielectric structures can also be treated using {OSRC.} These will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.},

Plasmonic light concentrators can elegantly interface diffraction-limited dielectric optical components with nanophotonic structures. Passive and active plasmonic devices provide new pathways to generate, guide, modulate and detect light with structures that are similar in size to state-of-the-art electronic devices. With the ability to produce highly confined optical fields, the conventional rules for light–matter interactions need to be re-examined, and researchers are venturing into new regimes of optical physics.

The embedded Voronoi graph contains the full symbolic information of the Voronoi diagram and the medial axis of the object, and a geometric approximation to the real geometry. The embedded Voronoi graph is used for decomposing the object, with the guiding principle that resulting sub-volumes are sweepable. Sub-volumes are meshed independently, and the resulting meshes are combined and smoothed to yield the final mesh. The approach presented here is general and automatic. It handles any volume, even if its medial axis is degenerate. The embedded Voronoi graph provides complete information regarding proximity and adjacency relationships between the entities of the volume. Hence, decomposition faces are determined unambiguously, without any further geometric computations. The sub-volumes computed by the algorithm are guaranteed to be well-defined and disjoint. The size of the decomposition is relatively small since every sub-volume contains a different Voronoi face. Mesh quality seems high since the decomposition avoids generation of sharp angles, and sweep and other basic methods are used to mesh the sub-volumes.},

The present methods are rigorously adapted to the conventional case of the signal available on a sparse equidistant time grid and use a more efficient boxlike filter. Various applications are discussed, such as iterative diagonalization of large Hamiltonian matrices for calculating bound and resonance states, scattering calculations in the presence of narrow resonances, etc. For the scattering problem the harmonic inversion is directly applied to the signal {cn=(chif,Tn(H)chii)}, generated by the dynamical system governed by a modified Chebyshev recursion, avoiding the usual recasting the problem to the time domain. Some challenging numerical examples are presented. The general filter-diagonalization method is shown to be stable and efficient for the extraction of thousands of complex frequencies omegak and amplitudes dk from a signal. When the model signal is "spoiled" by a moderate amount of an additive Gaussian noise the obtained spectral estimate is still superior to the conventional Fourier spectrum.},

	abstract = {A concise formulation of the frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} method is presented using the trapezoidal recursive convolution {(TRC)} technique for the analysis of a Drude-Lorentz model. The {TRC} technique requires single convolution integral in the formulation as in the recursive convolution {(RC)} technique, while maintaining the accuracy comparable to the piecewise linear {RC} {(PLRC)} technique with two convolution integrals. The {TRC} technique is introduced not only to the traditional explicit {FDTD}, but also to the unconditionally stable implicit {FDTD} based on the locally one-dimensional {(LOD)} scheme. Through the analysis of a surface plasmon waveguide, the effectiveness of the {TRC} technique is investigated for both explicit {FDTD} and {LOD-FDTD}, along with the existing {RC} and {PLRC} techniques.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new automatic strategy for adaptive tetrahedral mesh generation. A local refinement/derefinement algorithm for nested triangulations and a simultaneous untangling and smoothing procedure are the main involved techniques. The mesh generator is applied to 3-D complex domains whose boundaries are projectable on external faces of a meccano approximation composed of cuboids. The domain surfaces must be given by a mapping between meccano surfaces and object boundary. This mapping can be defined by analytical or discrete functions. At present, we have fixed mappings with orthogonal, cylindrical and radial projections, but any other one-to-one projection may be considered. The mesh generator starts from a coarse and valid hexahedral mesh that is obtained by an admissible subdivision of the meccano cuboids. The automatic subdivision of each hexahedron into six tetrahedra produces an initial tetrahedral mesh of the meccano approximation. The main idea is to construct a sequence of nested meshes by refining only those tetrahedra with a face on the meccano boundary. The virtual projection of meccano external faces defines a valid triangulation on the domain boundary. Then a 3-D local refinement/derefinement is carried out so that the approximation of domain surfaces verifies a given precision. Once this objective is reached, those nodes placed on the meccano boundary are really projected on their corresponding true boundary, and inner nodes are relocated using a suitable mapping. As the mesh topology is kept during node movement, poor quality or even inverted elements could appear in the resulting mesh; therefore, we finally apply a mesh optimization procedure. The efficiency of the proposed technique is shown with several applications to complex objects.},

	abstract = {Germanium nanowires were synthesized using thermal chemical vapor deposition {(CVD)} and indium as a catalyst. The process parameter space for successful growth was studied. By optimizing the growth temperature and gas pressure, high aspect ratio germanium nanowires have been obtained. Scanning electron microscopy investigations indicate that the final diameter of the nanowires is strongly influenced by the growth temperature and the germane partial pressure. High resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that nanowires grow either as high quality single crystalline, or with a high quality single-crystalline core and a concentric amorphous shell. The occurrence of these two morphologies is found to only depend on the wire diameter. Chemical analysis of the nanowire tip indicates the presence of indium, validating its role as a catalyst. Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a higher incidence of core–shell structures for nanowires synthesized at 30 Torr and indicate the presence of tensile strain. These results are important towards obtaining high quality germanium nanowires without the use of gold as a catalyst, which is known to degrade the wires' electrical and optical properties.},

The nanowire calculations are based on the finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} method in two dimensions, and we specifically consider the transmission of light through nanowire arrays, as this provides a simple nanomaterial construct which still displays the richness of optical phenomena that is found for more general nanostructures. The calculations show a number of features that are known for other nanostructures, including the red-shifting of plasmon resonances as wire spacing is decreased, and as particle aspect ratio is increased. In addition, the influence of dielectric coatings on the wires is examined, including factors which determine dielectric sensitivity.

The results are based on coupled dipole approximation calculations, and there are important constraints on particle size, spacing and array size to produce these effects. The simulation shows that the incident wave vector can be rotated 90° using a chain structure in which the illuminated particles are spaced by slightly larger than the wavelength and the not-illuminated particles are spaced by approximately half the wavelength. We show that the near-fields around the not-illuminated particles can be ten times higher than around the illuminated particles for appropriately chosen array structures.},

	abstract = {The assessment of bidirectional heuristic search has been incorrect since it was first published more than a quarter of a century ago. For quite a long time, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was a major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding. Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding unidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a search strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional heuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered.},

We also examine the propagation of light pulses in waveguides with adiabatically, longitudinally varying core refractive index. The effective refractive indices extracted from these simulations confirm previous theoretical predictions while, both a slowing and an increase in the amplitude of the pulses are observed.},

In the proposed coupler the dielectric waveguide and {LRSPP} waveguide are vertically configured for dense integration and strong coupling. The characteristics of the even and odd super-modes of the coupler are also analyzed to design the device. The fabricated device exhibits damped sinusoidal behavior along the coupling length due to propagation loss of the {LRSPP} waveguide. The maximum power transfer of 86\% from the {LRSPP} waveguide to the dielectric waveguide is achieved at the coupling length of 600 [mu]m. The measured characteristics of the device are in relatively good agreement with a theoretical analysis.},

	url = {http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure},
	abstract = {In computer science, an array data structure or simply an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.

For example, an array of 10 integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, … 2036, so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + 4 × i.

Arrays are analogous to the mathematical concepts of vectors, matrices, and tensors. Indeed, arrays with one or two indices are often called vectors or matrices, respectively. Arrays are often used to implement tables, especially lookup tables; the word table is sometimes used as a synonym of array.

Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.

Arrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually, but not always, fixed while the array is in use.

The term array is often used to mean array data type, a kind of data type provided by most high-level programming languages that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures.

The term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or "abstract array", a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or {ADT)} intended to capture the essential properties of arrays.},

An intuitive analytical ray-optics-based model is developed and used to capture the behavior of the quality factor {(Q)} as a function of the disk size and the attenuation coefficient. Two regimes in the behavior of Q with the disk size establish a simple design rule for optimizing the performance of these cavities. The validity of our analytical model is verified by full-vectorial finite element method calculations of the microcavity modes. Based on the predictions of the analytical and numerical calculations, we have fabricated microdisk resonators with diameters ranging between 2 and 8 μm. Q{\textgreater}103 are obtained for disk radii as small as 4 μm—highest observed for Si-nanocrystal-doped microdisk resonators. The fundamental limit on Q is estimated by quantifying all of the potential optical loss processes through a careful analysis which includes the effects of nanocrystal size distribution. Our theoretical calculations match well with experiments and reveal that the line-edge roughness scattering and radiation loss can be minimized sufficiently to enable study and quantification of more fundamental optical loss processes of this material due to band-to-band absorption, Mie scattering, and free-carrier absorption in the Si nanocrystals. Using the experimental Q’s and the mode volumes, we predict the maximum low-temperature Purcell enhancement factor in our structures on the order of 6 and with some design improvements enhancements up to 50 can be realized.},

Such antennas may be applied for sensing of biological nano particles as well as for single molecule detection. Because of considerable material losses and strong dispersion of metals at optical frequencies, the numerical analysis of plasmonic antennas is very demanding. An additional difficulty is caused when very narrow gaps between nano particles are utilized for increasing the field enhancement. In this paper we discuss the main difficulties of time domain solvers, namely {FDTD} and {FVTD} and we compare various frequency domain solvers, namely the commercial {FEM} packages {JCMsuite}, Comsol, {HFSS}, and Microwave Studio with the semi-analytic {MMP} code that may be used as a reference due to its fast convergence and high accuracy.},

	abstract = {The finite element method is one of the preeminent simulation techniques for obtaining solutions to boundary-value problems in mathematical physics. It has applications in a variety of engineering and scientific studies, such as antennas, radar, microwave engineering, high-speed/high-frequency circuits, wireless communication, electro-optical engineering, remote sensing, bioelectromagnetics, and geoelectromagnetics. This Second Edition of an essential text teaches the finite element method for electromagnetic analysis. It offers engineers a methodical way to quickly master this very powerful technique for solving practical, often complicated, engineering problems.
This book provides the first systematic treatment of this numerical analysis technique for electromagnetics, including a brief overview of the two classic methods-the Ritz variational method and Galerkin's method-which form the foundation of the finite element function. Employing an example to introduce the concept of the finite element method and describe the essential steps of the technique, the author lays the groundwork for a broad-based understanding of the finite element method's usefulness. He completes his coverage by describing the finite element analysis of one-, two-, and three-dimensional problems, developing for each problem a rigorous finite element solution in general form from which solutions to specific problems can be deduced.
Carefully updated to include the most recent developments, the Second Edition now includes new coverage of:
* Absorbing boundary conditions
* A hybrid technique for pen-region scattering and radiation problems
* Eigenfunction expansions on elliptical boundaries
* Time-domain analysis of transient electromagnetic problems
* The method of moments and its fast solvers},

Using the example of Au nanospheres embedded in the {GaN} dielectric, we show that enhancement for each case depends strongly on the original radiative efficiency of the emitter, the nanoparticle size, and the separation between the emitter and metal nanosphere. We demonstrate that strong enhancement favors the closely spaced emitters and metal nanospheres, but putting them too close to each other does not always produce additional enhancement. Thus, our model provides analytical treatment of the luminescence quenching and can be used to optimize both nanoparticle size and its separation from the emitter to yield maximum enhancement factor.},

The link between and [omega]p in dense gold is found using a simplification of the Bergman expansion for permittivity valid at infra-red wavelengths. The carrier relaxation time of the "effective metal" becomes the actual relaxation time in the Au network and the complex refractive indices (n, k) found using normal incidence spectrophotometry and oblique incidence ellipsometry agree closely with each other. The single pole approximation for the ratio in the infra-red allows estimates of void content and the apparent shift in carrier effective mass. It is then possible to model with no adjustable parameters, the full {UV-visible-NIR} spectral response, giving excellent agreement with data. A range of films with these properties are presented.},

	abstract = {Frequency selective surfaces {(FSS)} are often analyzed using frequency domain integral equation formulations and the method of moments {(MoM)} solutions. Because of the required evaluation of periodic Green's functions, and the frequent desire to repeat the analysis at multiple frequencies, these approaches can become computationally intensive. For normal incidence, the finite difference-time domain {(FD-TD)} provides an alternate approach, since symmetry of the fields permits the use of a periodic side boundary condition, while modeling only a single period of the infinite structure. For the oblique case, where the periodic boundary becomes non-causal, several {FD-TD} approaches have been proposed. However, these methods all involve either potentially divergent iterative solutions for the time advanced boundary, or phase shifting approaches which limit the excitation to a single frequency. This paper presents an alternative {FD-TD} approach to the oblique incidence problem. New field quantities are defined related to the electric and magnetic fields through spatially varying time shifts. The {FD-TD} discretization is then applied to Maxwell's equations rewritten in terms of these new field quantities. This transformation permits the use of an unshifted periodic boundary, and allows the simulation of {FSS} scattering at oblique incidence for multiple frequencies.},

	abstract = {The recently emerged fields of metamaterials and transformation optics promise a family of exciting applications such as invisibility, optical imaging with deeply subwavelength resolution and nanophotonics with the potential for much faster information processing. The possibility of creating optical negative-index metamaterials {(NIMs)} using nanostructured metal–dielectric composites has triggered intense basic and applied research over the past several years. However, the performance of all {NIM} applications is significantly limited by the inherent and strong energy dissipation in metals, especially in the near-infrared and visible wavelength ranges. Generally the losses are orders of magnitude too large for the proposed applications, and the reduction of losses with optimized designs seems to be out of reach. One way of addressing this issue is to incorporate gain media into {NIM} designs. However, whether {NIMs} with low loss can be achieved has been the subject of theoretical debate. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the incorporation of gain material in the high-local-field areas of a metamaterial makes it possible to fabricate an extremely low-loss and active optical {NIM.} The original loss-limited negative refractive index and the figure of merit {(FOM)} of the device have been drastically improved with loss compensation in the visible wavelength range between 722 and 738 nm. In this range, the {NIM} becomes active such that the sum of the light intensities in transmission and reflection exceeds the intensity of the incident beam. At a wavelength of 737 nm, the negative refractive index improves from −0.66 to −1.017 and the {FOM} increases from 1 to 26. At 738 nm, the {FOM} is expected to become macroscopically large, of the order of 106. This study demonstrates the possibility of fabricating an optical negative-index metamaterial that is not limited by the inherent loss in its metal constituent.},

A Fabry-P´erot model was formulated that successfully predicts both the peak position and spectral shape of their optical resonances. This model requires knowledge of the {SR-SPP} reflection amplitude and phase pickup upon reflection from the structure terminations. These quantities were first estimated using an intuitive Fresnel reflection model and then calculated exactly using full-field simulations based on the finite-difference frequency-domain {(FDFD)} method.

Throughput refers to the minimum achievable rate between a source-destination pair for a given routing mechanism and physical model, when the network is shared by Θ(n) randomly chosen source-destination pairs. The main idea is to use a connectivity graph, which does not represent the actual physical network but rather the available communication resources. This graph also allows one to translate the problem of maximizing the throughput in ad hoc networks to the multicommodity flow problem and directly apply related results.},

The discrete modes for a finite chain are first calculated, then these are mapped onto the dispersion relations appropriate for the infinite chain. Computed results are given for a chain of 50 nm diam Ag spheres spaced by 75 nm. We find large deviations from previous quasistatic results: Transverse modes interact strongly with the light line. Longitudinal modes develop a bandwidth more than twice as large, resulting in a group velocity that is more than doubled.

These methods are warranted by the extreme importance of dispersion to the propagation behavior of femtosecond-duration optical pulses. Input-invariant and frequency-approximation methods of designing discrete analogs of continuous-time dispersive electromagnetic systems are presented. Our methods are shown to unify existing design techniques. The inherent accuracy of each dispersive design is quantified by truncation error and frequency response methods, and stability analysis of the total {FDTD} system is found through root locus techniques. Implementation of the design is accomplished by algebraic manipulation of the system function in the frequency domain, resulting in canonical, partial fraction, or cascade structures that minimize the number of stored variables and provide trade-off between efficiency and sensitivity to finite precision.},

The infrared laser is considered to be near-resonant with two of the conduction states of the quantum dot, coherently mixing them together. Via exciton–plasmon coupling, this process normalizes the internal field of the metallic nanoparticle, forming a plasmonic (thermal) electromagnetically induced transparency. When this process happens the metallic nanoparticle becomes nearly completely non-dissipative around its plasmon frequency, while it remains strongly dissipative at other frequencies. We show that, by adjusting the intensity of the infrared laser, one can control the transparency window width and optical Stark shift associated with such a process.},

	abstract = {Linear arrays of very small Ag nanoparticles (diameter ∼10 nm, spacing 0–4 nm) were fabricated in sodalime glass using an ion irradiation technique. Optical extinction spectroscopy of the arrays reveals a large polarization-dependent splitting of the collective plasmon extinction band. Depending on the preparation condition, a redshift of the longitudinal resonance as large as 1.5 {eV} is observed. Simulations of the three-dimensional electromagnetic field evolution are used to determine the resonance energy of idealized nanoparticle arrays with different interparticle spacings and array lengths. Using these data, the experimentally observed redshift is attributed to collective plasmon coupling in touching particles and/or in long arrays of strongly coupled particles. The simulations also indicate that for closely coupled nanoparticles (1–2 nm spacing) the electromagnetic field is concentrated in nanoscale regions (10 {dB} radius: 3 nm) between the particles, with a 5000-fold local field intensity enhancement. In arrays of 1-nm-spaced particles the dipolar particle interaction extends to over 10 particles, while for larger spacing the interaction length decreases. Spatial images of the local field distribution in 12-particle arrays of touching particles reveal a particlelike coupled mode with a resonance at 1.8 {eV} and a wirelike mode at 0.4 {eV.}},

The photonic crystal slab consists of a silicon-on-insulator substrate with a triangular array of holes, in which the silicon layer is the optical guiding layer. The transmission spectra of the two-dimensional system and the slab system differ significantly. The slab system supports only a small range of frequencies in which a guided mode exists. In this frequency range, the transmission is comparable with that of the two-dimensional system, and its value is around 0.8. For the other frequencies, where for the slab system only resonances exist, the transmission is much lower than that of the two-dimensional system because of losses in the photonic crystal waveguide. Therefore, we conclude that complete three-dimensional computations have to be performed to obtain quantitative results for photonic crystal slab systems. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

This book covers the introduction and motivation of simplified models of neurons that are suitable for exploring information processing in large brain-like networks. Additionally, it introduces several fundamental network architectures and discusses their relevance for information processing in the brain, giving some examples of models of higher-order cognitive functions to demonstrate the advanced insight that can be gained with such studies.

Such {SPPs} are involved in a wide range of phenomena, including nanoscale optical waveguiding, perfect lensing, extraordinary optical transmission, subwavelength lithography and ultrahigh-sensitivity biosensing. However, before the full potential of technology based on {SPPs} (termed 'plasmonics') can be realized, many fundamental questions regarding the interaction between light and matter at the nanoscale need to be answered. For over 200 years, Young's double-slit experiment has been a valuable pedagogical tool for demonstrating the wave nature of light. Here, we perform a double-slit experiment with {SPPs} to reveal the strong analogy between {SPP} propagation along the surface of metallic structures and light propagation in conventional dielectric components (such as glass waveguides). This allows us to construct a general framework to describe the propagation, diffraction and interference of {SPPs.} It also suggests that there is an effective diffraction limit for the lateral confinement of {SPPs} on metal stripe waveguides, and justifies the use of well-developed concepts from conventional optics and photonics in the design of new plasmonic devices.},

We consider both nondissipative and lossy metallic components characterized by a complex frequency-dependent dielectric function. Our analysis is based on the calculation of the complex photonic band structure obtained by using a modified plane-wave method that transforms the problem of solving Maxwell’s equations into the problem of diagonalizing an equivalent non-Hermitian matrix. In order to investigate the nature and the symmetry properties of the eigenvectors, which significantly affect the optical properties of the photonic lattices, we evaluate the associated field distribution at the high symmetry points and along high symmetry directions in the two-dimensional first Brillouin zone of the periodic system. By considering both lossless and lossy metallic rods we study the effect of damping on the spatial distribution of the eigenvectors. Then we use the Hellmann-Feynman theorem and the eigenvectors and eigenfrequencies obtained from a photonic band-structure calculation based on a standard plane-wave approach applied to the nondissipative system to calculate the components of the group velocities associated with individual bands as functions of the wave vector in the first Brillouin zone. From the group velocity of each eigenmode the flow of energy is examined. The results obtained indicate a strong directional dependence of the group velocity, and confirm the experimental observation that a photonic crystal is a potentially efficient tool in controlling photon propagation.},

	abstract = {In adaptive finite element analysis, h-type refinement can be achieved basically in two ways: (i) small elements are connected directly to large elements with full compatibility at element interfaces and (ii) transitional elements are employed to link up elements of different sizes. While there is no difficulty in generating gradation triangular and tetrahedral meshes, generation of quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes of varying element sizes without severe element distortion proved to be a formidable task. The use of transitional elements allows meshes to be refined without element distortion, and the price that we have to pay is to develop general and efficient transitional elements in two and three dimensions.
Transition elements, which satisfy the patch test, can be formulated by means of the enhanced assumed strain {(EAS)} method, which are in general more efficient than the incompatible elements. Alternatively, in this paper, we try to develop a series of versatile transition elements based on the hybrid stress approach. Direct designing stress fields for transition elements is just too complicated and especially impractical for {3D} transition hexahedral elements. However, we found that the same stress field could be used for transition elements with variable number of nodes. By means of elimination and through numerical studies on some benchmark problems, 7- and 24-mode stress fields are adopted, respectively for {2D} quadrilateral and {3D} hexahedral hybrid stress transition elements. Strategy for generating refinement transition element meshes will be discussed, and the size of elements generated by the 1-irregular mesh restriction is compared with the predicted element size. The comparison shows that the meshing strategy employed in this study can effectively lead to an optimal mesh whose solution error is smaller than the prescribed one.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btl355},
	abstract = {Motivation: A major problem for current peak detection algorithms is that noise in mass spectrometry {(MS)} spectra gives rise to a high rate of false positives. The false positive rate is especially problematic in detecting peaks with low amplitudes. Usually, various baseline correction algorithms and smoothing methods are applied before attempting peak detection. This approach is very sensitive to the amount of smoothing and aggressiveness of the baseline correction, which contribute to making peak detection results inconsistent between runs, instrumentation and analysis methods. Results: Most peak detection algorithms simply identify peaks based on amplitude, ignoring the additional information present in the shape of the peaks in a spectrum. In our experience, true' peaks have characteristic shapes, and providing a shape-matching function that provides a goodness of fit' coefficient should provide a more robust peak identification method. Based on these observations, a continuous wavelet transform {(CWT)-based} peak detection algorithm has been devised that identifies peaks with different scales and amplitudes. By transforming the spectrum into wavelet space, the pattern-matching problem is simplified and in addition provides a powerful technique for identifying and separating the signal from the spike noise and colored noise. This transformation, with the additional information provided by the {2D} {CWT} coefficients can greatly enhance the effective signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, with this technique no baseline removal or peak smoothing preprocessing steps are required before peak detection, and this improves the robustness of peak detection under a variety of conditions. The algorithm was evaluated with {SELDI-TOF} spectra with known polypeptide positions. Comparisons with two other popular algorithms were performed. The results show the {CWT-based} algorithm can identify both strong and weak peaks while keeping false positive rate low. Availability: The algorithm is implemented in R and will be included as an open source module in the Bioconductor project.

Treating absorption and scattering in equal measure, this self-contained, interdisciplinary study examines and illustrates how small particles absorb and scatter light. The authors emphasize that any discussion of the optical behavior of small particles is inseparable from a full understanding of the optical behavior of the parent material-bulk matter. To divorce one concept from the other is to render any study on scattering theory seriously incomplete.
Special features and important topics covered in this book include:
* Classical theories of optical properties based on idealized models
* Measurements for three representative materials: magnesium oxide, aluminum, and water
* An extensive discussion of electromagnetic theory
* Numerous exact and approximate solutions to various scattering problems
* Examples and applications from physics, astrophysics, atmospheric physics, and biophysics
* Some 500 references emphasizing work done since Kerker's 1969 work on scattering theory
* Computer programs for calculating scattering by spheres, coated spheres, and infinite cylinders},

The integrand of the functional is the non-dimensional ratio of the invariants of the metric. The functional depends on metric elements of two metrics. The curvilinear mesh, generated in the manifold, induces the monitor metric. Another control metric, defined in a special way, is responsible for additional cell shape control.

If the propagation of the incident field is grid-aligned, a perfect {TFSF} implementation can be realized by using an auxiliary one-dimensional {FDTD} simulation which models propagation of the incident field. Here "perfect" implies the incident field propagation exactly matches the way in which the field propagates in the {FDTD} grid. However, for propagation which is not grid-aligned, no similarly perfect implementation has previously been presented. This work provides a framework for a perfect {TFSF} boundary for pulsed plane waves which do not propagate in a grid-aligned fashion. To achieve this, homogeneous plane-wave propagation is rigorously quantified. Using this knowledge and a specification of the desired incident field, the dispersion relation is used to ascertain the incident field at any point in the grid. It is required to account for, unlike in the continuous world, the electric field, the magnetic field, and the wavenumber vector not forming a mutually orthogonal set.

	abstract = {A variational method of constructing a spatial structured grid composed of hexahedral cells is presented. The method executes a minimization of the variational functional. The integrand of the functional is a ratio of the orthogonal invariants. The functional depends on two metrics. One metric is induced by a curvilinear mesh generated in the physical domain and the other control metric, given in the canonical domain, is responsible for an additional cell shape control, for instance, for condensing the coordinate surfaces and orthogonalization of the grid lines towards the domain boundary. Generally, defining the control metric allows to generate an arbitrary given non-folded mesh in the physical domain. For every cell, the functional is discretized on ten tetrahedra forming two dodecahedrons with the same vertices which span the hexahedral cell. The discrete functional possesses an infinite barrier on the boundary of the set of non-folded dodecahedral cells that ensures the construction of the non-folded grid composed of such cells. In the most practical cases the hexahedral grid with the same nodes is non-folded as well. The method of boundary nodes redistribution is considered. Examples of the grid construction are reported.},

	abstract = {The energy frontier of particle physics is several trillion electron volts, but colliders capable of reaching this regime (such as the Large Hadron Collider and the International Linear Collider) are costly and time-consuming to build; it is therefore important to explore new methods of accelerating particles to high energies. Plasma-based accelerators are particularly attractive because they are capable of producing accelerating fields that are orders of magnitude larger than those used in conventional colliders1, 2, 3. In these accelerators, a drive beam (either laser or particle) produces a plasma wave (wakefield) that accelerates charged particles4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The ultimate utility of plasma accelerators will depend on sustaining ultrahigh accelerating fields over a substantial length to achieve a significant energy gain. Here we show that an energy gain of more than 42 {GeV} is achieved in a plasma wakefield accelerator of 85 cm length, driven by a 42 {GeV} electron beam at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center {(SLAC).} The results are in excellent agreement with the predictions of three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Most of the beam electrons lose energy to the plasma wave, but some electrons in the back of the same beam pulse are accelerated with a field of approx52 {GV} m-1. This effectively doubles their energy, producing the energy gain of the 3-km-long {SLAC} accelerator in less than a metre for a small fraction of the electrons in the injected bunch. This is an important step towards demonstrating the viability of plasma accelerators for high-energy physics applications.},

The dynamic dispersion relations of the {2D} arrays are obtained through a method which gives an effective polarizability describing the collective response of a system. Both the dispersion relations and mode qualities are simultaneously related to the imaginary part of the effective polarizability, which has contributions from the single-particle response as well as the interparticle coupling. The transverse long-range dipolar interaction is dominated by a wave term together with a purely geometrical constant representing the static geometrical contribution to resonant frequencies. As concrete examples, we considered small Ag spheres arranged in a square lattice. We find that inside the light cone, the transverse quasimode has a reasonably high mode quality, while the two in-plane modes show significant radiation damping. Near the light line, we observe strong coupling with free photons for the bands of the transverse mode and the transverse in-plane mode, and the longitudinal in-plane mode exhibits a negative group velocity inside the light cone. Vanishing group velocities in the light cone for all the quasimodes are found to be intrinsic properties of the {2D} metal nanosphere dense arrays.},

As a main result we establish a fully dynamic maintenance algorithm for convex hulls that can process insertions and deletions of single points in only O(log2 n) steps per transaction, where n is the number of points currently in the set. The algorithm has several intriguing applications, including the fact that the "trimmed" mean of a set of n points in the plane can be determined in only O(n log2 n) steps. Likewise, efficient algorithms are obtained for dynamically maintaining the common intersection of a set of half-spaces and for dynamically maintaining the maximal elements of a set of points. The results are all derived by means of one master technique, which is applied repeatedly and which captures an appropriate notion of "decomposability" for configurations closely related to the existence of divide-and-conquer solutions.},

Artmann’s equation, which is accurate enough for bulk optics, is difficult to apply to waveguide-type {SPR} devices. This is because Artmann's equation, based on the differentiation of the phase shift, is inaccurate at the critical and resonance angles where drastic phase changes occur. In this study, we accurately identified both the positive and the negative {GH} shifts around the incidence angle of resonance. In a waveguide-type Kretchmann-Raether configuration with an Au thin film of 50 nm, positive and negative lateral shifts of −0.75 and + 1.0 μm are obtained on the {SPR} with the incident angles of 44.4 ° and 47.5 °, respectively, at a wavelength of 632.8 nm.},

	abstract = {Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.

The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, and substantial additions to the chapter on recurrences (now called {"Divide-and-Conquer").} It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many new exercises and problems have been added for this edition.

As of the third edition, this textbook is published exclusively by the {MIT} Press.},

Propagating states can be transferred between the continuums through the resonator system. We show that the transport properties are intricately related to the symmetries of the resonant states. Complete transfer can be achieved by manipulating the symmetries of the system, and by forcing an accidental degeneracy between states with different symmetries. In addition, the line shape of the transfer spectrum can be engineered by varying the number of localized states in the resonator system. The theoretical analysis is confirmed by first-principles simulations of transport properties in a two-dimensional photonic crystal.},

Previous studies have shown that the energy transfer between two semi-infinite media separated by a nanometre vacuum gap is maximized when the real part of the dielectric function is around -1 due to the excitement of surface waves. Real materials can exhibit such a behaviour only within a very small spectral interval. However, by tuning the different adjustable parameters of the dielectric functions, it is possible to estimate the maximum achievable near-field radiative transfer. In this study, the influence of each parameter in the Drude and the Lorentz models on the nanoscale radiation is investigated. Optimal values are obtained for these parameters that maximize the near-field heat flux, which can be more than an order of magnitude higher than previously calculated values for {SiC} and doped Si. The effect of temperature on the optimal parameters in the Drude model is also discussed. The results will guide future selection and design of materials for the enhancement in near-field heat transfer.},

The samples are held at liquid-helium temperature and are pumped by intense femtosecond optical pulses at 0.81-µm center wavelength in a pump-probe geometry. We observe much larger relative transmittance changes (up to about 8\%) on the split-ring-resonator arrays as compared to the bare quantum well (not more than 1-2\%). We also observe a much more rapid temporal decay component of the differential transmittance signal of 15 ps for the case of split-ring resonators coupled to the quantum well compared to the case of the bare quantum well, where we find about 0.7 ns. These observations are ascribed to the evanescent coupling of the split-ring resonators to the quantum-well gain. All experimental results are compared with a recently introduced analytical toy model that accounts for this evanescent coupling, leading to excellent overall qualitative agreement.},

When compared to established carrier dynamical models, the dependence of {αFC} on optical pump intensity reveals enhanced nonradiative recombination at high pump intensity ({\textgreater}10 {KW/cm2)}, which can be explained by the interaction of excited carriers located in spatially separated {NCs.} The rate of recombination due to the interaction between a pair of excited {NCs} is determined to increase inversely with the sixth power of their separation distance {(τ−1∼γR−6;γ≈2.6×10−31} cm6 s−1) and is indicative of near-field dipole-dipole energy transfer. These results explain the source of an apparent inconsistency in power-law behavior found in previous carrier dynamics studies on similar materials which did not account for this interaction.},

Depending on the particular implementation, the embedded source corresponds physically to a hard field source (applied field), a transparent current source (impressed current), a finite-impedance voltage source, or some other physical excitation. While the implementation of any of these sources is a straightforward procedure in {FDTD} simulations, ensuring an accurate correspondence between the physical source and its numerical implementation is challenging. We describe the implementation of a new field source, referred to as a transparent field source, that couples the same fields into the {FDTD} grid as a hard field source. Unlike the hard field source, however, the transparent source does not scatter energy, i.e., the usual {FDTD} update equation applies to the source node. The implementation is described both in terms of a single node and in terms of an array of nodes. The latter is discussed in the context of parallel-plate waveguide excitation},

The structural characterization of the particle arrays was investigated by atomic force microscopy. In the optical absorption spectra, the metal-nanoparticle arrays show a strong absorption peak of {\textasciitilde} 550 nm due to the surface plasmon resonance of metal particles. The nonlinear optical properties of the nanoparticle arrays were determined using a single beam z-scan method at a wavelength of 532 nm with laser duration of 55 ps. By adding Fe, the resonant absorption of Au particles was quenched, and the figure of merit [chi](3)/[alpha] (with [chi](3) being the third-order nonlinear susceptibility, [alpha] being the absorption coefficient) was obviously increased. The obtained maximum [chi](3)/[alpha] is about 6.15 × 10- 12 esu cm. The results show that periodic Au + Fe nanoparticle arrays exhibit a large nonlinear optical property with fast response.},

We investigate the possibility of using arrays of closely spaced metal nanoparticles for this purpose. Coupling between adjacent particles sets up coupled plasmon modes that give rise to coherent propagation of energy along the array. A point dipole analysis predicts group velocities of energy transport that exceed 0.1c along straight arrays and shows that energy transmission and switching through chain networks such as corners (see Figure) and tee structures is possible at high efficiencies. Radiation losses into the far field are expected to be negligible due to the near-field nature of the coupling, and resistive heating leads to transmission losses of about 6 {dB/\&mgr;m} for gold and silver particles. We analyze macroscopic analogues operating in the microwave regime consisting of closely spaced metal rods by experiments and full field electrodynamic simulations. The guiding structures show a high confinement of the electromagnetic energy and allow for highly variable geometries and switching. Also, we have fabricated gold nanoparticle arrays using electron beam lithography and atomic force microscopy manipulation. These plasmon waveguides and switches could be the smallest devices with optical functionality.},

We have applied this technique to determine the {FCA} cross-section of Si nanocrystals {(Si-ncs)} in the visible−near-infrared wavelength range. Our procedure accounts for the size distribution effects by including the measured wavelength dependence of the excitation cross-section and the decay rate of photoexcited carriers in the analysis. By monitoring the {WGM} widths at various wavelengths in the 700−900 nm wavelength range, we found that the {FCA} cross-section follows an approximately quadratic wavelength dependence. The magnitude of the {FCA} cross-section of Si nanocrystals was determined to be a factor of 7 higher than that in bulk Si. For this reason, these findings have important implications for the design of Si-based lasers and all-optical switching devices in which {FCA} plays a critical role.},

	abstract = {The main focus of this dissertation is the development of full-wave modeling and the analysis of dispersion-engineered materials and plasmon waveguides. Among dispersion-engineered structures, we in particular focus on slow-wave photonic crystals {(PhCs)} where the dispersion curve ω(k) is approximated as a cubic polynomial, a quartic polynomial, or a linear combination of a quadratic polynomial and a quartic polynomial. We propose and investigate new compact plasmon waveguides operating at optical communication band (λ0 ∼ 1550 nm).

Slow-wave {PhCs} may consist of periodic arrangements of complex media such as ferromagnetic materials and anisotropic dielectrics. The dispersion curve is tailored by the choice of geometries and materials for each unit cell. We develop finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} algorithms suitable for the analysis of slow-wave {PhCs.} This will be performed by decoupling the time-marching update equations into two steps, viz. one associated with Maxwell’s equations and the other associated with the constitutive relations. The complex-frequency-shifted {(CFS)-perfectly} matched layer {(PML)} is employed to minimize spurious reflections from the outer boundary of the computational domain. We further extend the complex-envelope {(CE)-alternating-direction-implicit} {(ADI)-FDTD} algorithm to anisotropic media, in order to lift the Courant stability limit with no loss of accuracy.


Plasmon structures are based on metallic nanostructures and they are of great interest due to their extraordinary properties such as subwavelength guiding and highly localized field phenomena. By harnessing the extraordinary optical properties of plasmon structures, we propose two types of compact plasmon waveguides operating at optical communication band. The first plasmon waveguide is based on an ordered array of gold nanorings. Electromagnetic fields are guided along this nanoparticle-based plasmon waveguide by near-field coupling between closely spaced nanoparticles. The second plasmon waveguide is based on a surface plasmon {(SP)-coplanar} waveguide {(CPW).} The {SP-CPW} yields compact mode confinement and moderate propagation loss. The analysis and design of these two types of plasmon waveguides will be performed using the 3-D {CFS-PML-FDTD} algorithm extended for the Drude dispersion model.

Further algorithm improvements are described. We propose an efficient time-domain modeling for plasmon structures in the visible spectrum, based on the extension of the {ADI-FDTD} algorithm to the multispecies Drude-Lorentz dispersion model. We also introduce a novel locally-one-dimensional {(LOD)-FDTD} algorithm based on an iterative fixed-point correction to reduce the splitting error. Lastly, we investigate numerical artifacts of the {CE-ADI-FDTD} algorithm and discuss the way to reduce these numerical artifacts.},

	abstract = {The finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} method has been applied to time-resolved {THz} spectroscopy {(TRTS)} experiments. Time-resolved {THz} spectroscopy utilizes an optical pump pulse to excite the sample, followed by a far-infrared {(FIR)} probe pulse with frequency components that span from 10 to 100 cm−1. The subpicosecond evolution of the {FIR} spectrum is obtained as a function of time after the visible photoexcitation event. Significant challenges arise in interpreting these experimental results due to the very different frequencies of the pump and probe pulses. Therefore, it is essential to simulate the experiment. The method described entails numerically propagating both the {THz} probe pulse and the visible pump pulse simultaneously, keeping track of the transiently induced polarization from absorption of the visible pulse. Group velocity mismatch between the visible and {THz} pulse and a transiently changing response function are completely accounted for in the calculation. Furthermore, a spatially varying polarization can be included to account for a nonuniform excited region of the sample under investigation. The response function of the material is described as a multimode Brownian oscillator that can describe dispersive media in a very general sense. In particular, the overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped cases are all included, as well as special cases such as a Debye or Drude response. As a specific example, we present results of modeling a {TRTS} experiment of photoexcitation of a dye in solution, namely, 2,11,20,29-tetra-tert-butyl-2,3-napthalocyanine, dissolved in toluene. We carry out a nonlinear least squares fit of a parameterized model to the measured data to show that the {FDTD–TRTS} method is able to accurately reproduce the features observed in the measured data set.},

	abstract = {High-performance computing has recently seen a surge of interest in heterogeneous systems, with an emphasis on modern Graphics Processing Units {(GPUs).} These devices offer tremendous potential for performance and efficiency in important large-scale applications of computational science. However, exploiting this potential can be challenging, as one must adapt to the specialized and rapidly evolving computing environment currently exhibited by {GPUs.} One way of addressing this challenge is to embrace better techniques and develop tools tailored to their needs. This article presents one simple technique, {GPU} run-time code generation {(RTCG)}, along with {PyCUDA} and {PyOpenCL}, two open-source toolkits that supports this technique.

In introducing {PyCUDA} and {PyOpenCL}, this article proposes the combination of a dynamic, high-level scripting language with the massive performance of a {GPU} as a compelling two-tiered computing platform, potentially offering significant performance and productivity advantages over conventional single-tier, static systems. The concept of {RTCG} is simple and easily implemented using existing, robust infrastructure. Nonetheless it is powerful enough to support (and encourage) the creation of custom application-specific tools by its users. The premise of the paper is illustrated by a wide range of examples where the technique has been applied with considerable success.},

In it, the alternating direction implicit {(ADI)} technique is applied in formulating the finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} algorithm. Although the resulting formulations are computationally more complicated than the conventional {FDTD}, the proposed {FDTD} is very appealing since the time step used in the simulation is no longer restricted by stability but by accuracy. As a result, computation speed can be improved. It is found that the number of iterations with the proposed {FDTD} can be at least three times less than that with the conventional {FDTD} with the same numerical accuracy},

	abstract = {Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that have properties, such as a negative refractive index, not attainable with naturally occurring materials. Negative-index metamaterials {(NIMs)} were first demonstrated for microwave frequencies, but it has been challenging to design {NIMs} for optical frequencies and they have so far been limited to optically thin samples because of significant fabrication challenges and strong energy dissipation in metals. Such thin structures are analogous to a monolayer of atoms, making it difficult to assign bulk properties such as the index of refraction. Negative refraction of surface plasmons was recently demonstrated but was confined to a two-dimensional waveguide9. Three-dimensional {(3D)} optical metamaterials have come into focus recently, including the realization of negative refraction by using layered semiconductor metamaterials and a {3D} magnetic metamaterial in the infrared frequencies; however, neither of these had a negative index of refraction. Here we report a {3D} optical metamaterial having negative refractive index with a very high figure of merit of 3.5 (that is, low loss). This metamaterial is made of cascaded 'fishnet' structures, with a negative index existing over a broad spectral range. Moreover, it can readily be probed from free space, making it functional for optical devices. We construct a prism made of this optical {NIM} to demonstrate negative refractive index at optical frequencies, resulting unambiguously from the negative phase evolution of the wave propagating inside the metamaterial. Bulk optical metamaterials open up prospects for studies of {3D} optical effects and applications associated with {NIMs} and zero-index materials such as reversed Doppler effect, superlenses, optical tunnelling devices, compact resonators and highly directional sources.},

The method we use is a variant on the finite difference time domain {(FDTD)} method familiar to the electric engineering community, also known as the {order(N)} method. However, we employ a new transparent formalism which simplifies the stability analysis and identification of conserved quantities, as well as allowing the use of non-orthogonal coordinate systems without the usual computational overheads. Both the electric and magnetic fields are placed onto a discrete lattice by approximating the spacial and temporal derivatives with finite differences. This results in discrete versions of Maxwell's equations which can be used to integrate the fields forwards in time. The time required for a calculation using this method scales linearly with the number of real space points used in the discretisation so the technique is ideally suited to handling systems with large and complicated unit cells.},

Different integrators are constructed depending on the choice of discrete Lagrangian used to approximate the action. By combining discrete Lagrangians in an explicit symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta method, an integrator capable of achieving any order of accuracy is obtained. Using the von Neumann stability analysis, we show that the integrators greatly increase the numerical stability and reduce the numerical dispersion compared to other methods. For practical purposes, we demonstrate how to implement the integrators using many features of the finite-difference time-domain method. However, our approach is also applicable to other spatial discretizations, such as those used in finite element methods. Using this implementation, numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the ability of the integrators to efficiently reduce and maintain a minimal amount of numerical dispersion, particularly when the time-step is less than the stability limit. The integrators are therefore advantageous for modeling large, inhomogeneous computational domains.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a surface plasmon-polariton {(SPP)} waveguide all-optical switch that combines the unique physical properties of small molecules and metallic (plasmonic) nanostructures. The switch consists of a pair of gratings defined in an aluminum film coated with a 65 nm thick layer of photochromic {(PC)} molecules. The first grating couples a signal beam consisting of free space photons to {SPPs} that interact effectively with the {PC} molecules. These molecules can reversibly be switched between transparent and absorbing states using a free space optical pump. In the transparent (signal “on”) state, the {SPPs} freely propagate through the molecular layer, and in the absorbing (signal “off”) state, the {SPPs} are strongly attenuated. The second grating serves to decouple the {SPPs} back into a free space optical beam, enabling measurement of the modulated signal with a far-field detector. In a preliminary study, the switching behavior of the {PC} molecules themselves was confirmed and quantified by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. The excellent (16\%) overlap of the {SPP} mode profile with the thin layer of switching molecules enabled efficient switching with power densities of 6.0 {mW/cm2} in 1.5 µm × 8 µm devices, resulting in plasmonic switching powers of 0.72 {nW} per device. Calculations further showed that modulation depths in access of 20 {dB} can easily be attained in optimized designs. The quantitative experimental and theoretical analysis of the nonvolatile switching behavior in this letter guides the design of future nanoscale optically or electrically pumped optical switches.},

The method is based on an extension of the finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} method, originally proposed by Yee {[IEEE} Trans. Antennas Propag. 14, 302 (1966)], also known as the order-N method {[Chan}, Yu, and Ho, Phys. Rev. 51, 16 635 (1995)] which has recently become a popular way of calculating photonic band structures. We give a transparent derivation of the order-N method which, in turn, enables us to give a simple yet rigorous derivation of the criterion for numerical stability as well as statements of charge and energy conservation which are exact even on the discrete lattice. We implement this using a general, nonorthogonal coordinate system without incurring the computational overheads normally associated with nonorthogonal {FDTD.} We present results for local densities of states calculated using this method for a number of systems. First, we consider a simple one-dimensional dielectric multilayer, identifying the suppression in the state density caused by the photonic band gap and then observing the effect of introducing a defect layer into the periodic structure. Second, we tackle a more realistic example by treating a defect in a crystal of dielectric spheres on a diamond lattice. This could have application to the design of superefficient laser devices utilizing defects in photonic crystals as laser cavities.},

ranging from 650 ◦ C to 1100 ◦ C. The cavity Q of the spheres with
the active layer was measured at 1.56 μm using a tunable external
cavity coupled laser diode and a tapered fiber coupling. We find
that the presence of the nc-Si active layer reduces the Q value of
the microsphere from ≥2 × 107 to (2–5) × 105 . However, we found
no correlation between the formation, size, and density of the nc-Si

Combining a full-vectorial, magnetic field finite-difference method with complex coordinate stretching perfectly matched layer boundary conditions, we have solved for both the leaky and bound modes of metallic slab and stripe waveguides. Solutions for the leaky modes excited via attenuated total reflection in the Kretschmann configuration provide added insight into the results of recent near and far-field experimental studies. For these cases, an analytical approximation for the number of allowed modes as a function of waveguide width is derived based upon the guidance condition of dielectric waveguide theory. Then, consistent with a ray optics interpretation for surface plasmon-polariton propagation, a direct comparison is made between our simulations and published results with regard to field profiles and propagation lengths.},

Furthermore, we derive scaling limits for the bandwidth of dielectric antennas and describe a cylindrical mode which is unique in its ability to support extremely large bandwidths even when the particle size is deeply subwavelength. Finally, we show that higher Q antennas may couple more efficiently to an external load, but the optimal absorption cross-section depends only on the resonance frequency.},

At these pump intensities, the {PL} intensity tends to saturate and the {PL} decay rate decreases with increasing Iex. These results can be described within the construct of a quasi-two-level rate-equation model that allows for exciton-exciton Auger recombination. Analysis shows that the room-temperature Auger coefficient {(Ca)}, and thus, the Auger rate is roughly two orders of magnitude less than those estimated for silicon nanoparticles in an oxide matrix. The temperature dependence of the Auger process in the nanowires resembles bulk Si, in which Auger processes are phonon assisted. This work provides valuable quantitative information on one of the key nonradiative processes limiting optical gain from Si nanostructures and could prove important in the design of a Si-based laser.},

Using a model based on Maxwell-Bloch equations, which are modified to incorporate time-dependent gain and statistical character of spontaneous emission, the time-dependent nature of the interaction including coherent process is studied. The temporal shape of the output pulse is found to consist of three components: amplified spontaneous emission, coherent transient phase, and coherent decay. Based on this analysis, energy extraction and duration of the output pulse are discussed. The expectation regarding the properties such as radiation polarization, coherence, and divergence is also considered.},

Films with a stoichiometry of {SiO1.08N0.32} were prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition with {N2O} and {SiH4.} Strongly absorbing {CO2} laser light was then used to induce local heating in the films in air ambient using power densities in the range from 0 to 580 W/cm2 and times of 5 s to 60 min. High-resolution cross sectional transmission electron microscopy {(TEM)} images of the irradiated region revealed the presence of crystalline Si nanoparticles. Photoluminescence {(PL)} spectra taken from irradiated areas showed two distinct peaks around 570 and 800 nm. From a combined {TEM}, Rutherford back scattering {(RBS)}, forming gas annealing {(FGA)}, {PL}, and {PL} lifetime study it is concluded that the 570 nm peak with a short {PL} lifetime ({\textless}10 ns) is related to defects characteristic of silicon suboxides and that the 800 nm peak is due to exciton recombination inside the Si nanoparticles. The appearance of an isosbestic point in the {PL} spectra suggests that upon {CO2} laser heating Si nanoparticles are formed at the expense of the luminescent defect structures, which are annealed out.},

The combination of the von Neumann method with the Routh-Hurwitz criterion is proposed as an algebraic procedure for obtaining analytical closed-form stability expressions. This technique is applied to the problem of determining the stability conditions of an extension of the {FDTD} method to incorporate dispersive media previously reported in the literature. Both Debye and Lorentz dispersive media are considered. It is shown that, for the former case, the stability limit of the conventional {FDTD} method is preserved. However, for the latter case, a more restrictive stability limit is obtained. To overcome this drawback, a new scheme is presented, which allows the stability limit of the conventional {FDTD} method to be maintained.},

We compared two structures and tried to choose the best one, with lower losses and higher efficiency at the output branches, in order to split and transport the optical energy. Comparing the different types of nanoparticles corroborates that nanorings have an extra degree of tunability in their geometrical components. Meanwhile, nanorings show strong confinement in near-field coupling, less extinction coefficient, and also lower scattering into the far field during energy transportation at the C-band spectrum. Due to the nanoring’s particular properties, transportation losses would be lower than in other nanoparticle-based structures like nanospheres, nanorods, and nanodisks. We demonstrate that Au nanorings surrounded by an {SiO2} host yield suitable conditions to excite surface Plasmons inside the metal. Comparison between Y-and T-splitters shows that the Y-splitter is a more suitable alternative than the T-splitter, with higher transmission efficiency and lower losses. In the Y-structure, the power ratio (time-averaged power across the surface) is 24.7\%, and electromagnetic energy transportation takes place at group velocities in the vicinity of 30\% of the velocity of light; transmission losses are {γT=3}  {dB/655}  nm and {γT=3}  {dB/443}  nm.

	abstract = {Slow waves on chains or lattices of resonant elements offer a unique tool for guiding and manipulating the electromagnetic radiation on a subwavelength scale. Applications range from radio waves to optics with two major classes of structures being used: (i) metamaterials made of coupled ring resonators supporting magnetoinductive waves and (ii) plasmonic crystals made of nanoparticles supporting waves of near-field coupling. We derive dispersion equations of both types of slow waves for the case when the interelement coupling is governed by retardation effects, and show how closely they are related. The current distribution is found from Kirchhoff’s equation by inverting the impedance matrix. In contrast to previous treatments power conservation is demonstrated in a form relevant to a finite structure: the input power is shown to be equal to the radiated power plus the powers absorbed in the Ohmic resistance of the elements and the terminal impedance. The relations between frequency and wave number are determined for a 500-element line for two excitations using three different methods. Our approach of retrieval of the dispersion from driven solutions of finite lines is relevant for practical applications and may be used in the design of metamaterials and plasmonic crystals with desired properties.},

	abstract = {Optical techniques are finding widespread use in analytical chemistry for chemical and bio-chemical analysis. During the past decade, there has been an increasing emphasis on miniaturization of chemical analysis systems and naturally this has stimulated a large effort in integrating microfluidics and optics in lab-on-a-chip microsystems. This development is partly defining the emerging field of optofluidics. Scaling analysis and experiments have demonstrated the advantage of micro-scale devices over their macroscopic counterparts for a number of chemical applications. However, from an optical point of view, miniaturized devices suffer dramatically from the reduced optical path compared to macroscale experiments, e.g. in a cuvette. Obviously, the reduced optical path complicates the application of optical techniques in lab-on-a-chip systems. In this paper we theoretically discuss how a strongly dispersive photonic crystal environment may be used to enhance the light-matter interactions, thus potentially compensating for the reduced optical path in lab-on-a-chip systems. Combining electromagnetic perturbation theory with full-wave electromagnetic simulations we address the prospects for achieving slow-light enhancement of {Beer–Lambert–Bouguer} absorption, photonic band-gap based refractometry, and high-Q cavity sensing.},

The boundary conditions for a conductor rod which is not well suited to the Cartesian coordinate system are satisfied in an average fashion by introducing image fields at image points. It is shown that the present method gives accurate numerical results. Numerical calculations are also carried out for thick conducting rods which seem difficult to deal with in an analytical way.},

	abstract = {The underwater explosion {(UWE)} resulting in the sinking of the South Korean warship, {ROKS} Cheonan occurred on March 26 2010. Raw data was analyzed from several 3-component {stations—Baengyeong-do} Korea Meteorological Administration {(KMA)} station {(BAR)}, Ganghwa {KMA} station {(GAHB)}, Incheon Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology {(IRIS)} station {(INCN)}, the short-period {station—Deokjeok-do} {KMA} station {(DEI)}, as well as from the seismo-acoustic array Baengyeong-do Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources {(KIGAM)} station {(BRDAR).} The {ROKS} Cheonan incident has been investigated by both the Multinational Civilian-Military Joint Investigation Group {(Ministry} of National Defense, 2010) and Hong {(Bull} Seism Soc Am 101:1554–1562, 2011). Their respective methods and conclusions are also presented in this study. One of the main differences between their findings and ours is that we deducted that the fundamental bubble frequency was 1.01 Hz with a subsequent oscillation of 1.72 Hz. Also, in contrast to findings by the {MCMJIG} and Hong, our analysis shows the first reverberation frequency to be 8.5 Hz and the subsequent one to be ≈25 Hz. The {TNT-equivalent} charge weight (seismic yield) and seismic magnitude were estimated from an observed bubble frequency of 1.01 Hz and the analytical model of a bubble pulse. From the data analyzed, we deducted that the seismic yield would be about 136 kg of {TNT}, which is equivalent to the individual yield of a large number of land control mines {(LCM)} which were abandoned in the vicinity of the {ROKS} Cheonan incident by the Republic of Korea {(ROK)} Navy in the 1970s {(Ministry} of National Defense 2010). Also, whereas both the {MCMJIG} and {HONG} estimated the local magnitude at 1.5, our findings came to the conclusion of a local magnitude of approximately 2.04 based on the bubble frequency of 1.01 Hz measured on the vertical component of {BAR} station data considering the empirical relationship between charge weight {(TNT} yield) and underwater explosion magnitude. Strong high-frequency signals collected at the 3-component {BAR} station approximately 30 s after P-wave arrivals and infrasound records at {BRDAR} clearly indicate powerful acoustic phases and N-waves caused by a relatively shallow {UWE.} T-phases are also observed on seismograms and spectra at 15–17 Hz on the {DEI}, {GAHB}, and {INCN} stations.},

The mode permittivity change decays to an asymptote with the number of particles in the chain, and changes dramatically from 1/f3 to 1/f1/2 as the gap fraction (ratio of gap between spheres to their diameter), f, gets smaller. Scattering increases significantly with closer coupling.

	abstract = {Achieving control of light-material interactions for photonic device applications at nanoscale dimensions will require structures that guide electromagnetic energy with a lateral mode confinement below the diffraction limit of light. This cannot be achieved by using conventional waveguides or photonic crystals. It has been suggested that electromagnetic energy can be guided below the diffraction limit along chains of closely spaced metal nanoparticles that convert the optical mode into non-radiating surface plasmons. A variety of methods such as electron beam lithography and self-assembly have been used to construct metal nanoparticle plasmon waveguides. However, all investigations of the optical properties of these waveguides have so far been confined to collective excitations, and direct experimental evidence for energy transport along plasmon waveguides has proved elusive. Here we present observations of electromagnetic energy transport from a localized subwavelength source to a localized detector over distances of about 0.5 m in plasmon waveguides consisting of closely spaced silver rods. The waveguides are excited by the tip of a near-field scanning optical microscope, and energy transport is probed by using fluorescent nanospheres.},

	abstract = {You can immediately have the power to perform electromagnetic simulation. If you have a fundamental understanding of electromagnetic theory and the knowledge of at least one high-level computer language, you can begin writing simple electromagnetic simulation programs after reading the first chapter of this book.  Electromagnetic Simulation Using the {FDTD} Method describes the power and flexibility of the finite-difference time-domain method as a direct simulation of Maxwell's equations. The {FDTD} method takes advantage of today's advanced computing power because its computational requirements increase linearly with the size of the simulation problem.  This book begins with a simple one-dimensional simulation and progresses to a three-dimensional simulation. Each chapter contains a concise explanation of an essential concept and instruction on its implementation into computer code. Projects that increase in complexity are included, ranging from simulations in free space to propagation in dispersive media. Peripheral topics that are pertinent to time-domain simulation, such as Z-transforms and the discrete Fourier transform, are also covered.  Electromagnetic Simulation Using the {FDTD} Method is written for anyone who would like to learn electromagnetic simulation using the finite-difference time-domain method. Appropriate as both a textbook and for self-study, this tutorial-style book will provide all the background you will need to begin research or other practical work in electromagnetic simulation.},

The step-fiber approximation is more widely applicable than the Gaussian field approximation which is inadequate for small V and for describing the evanescent field.

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new algorithm called whisker weaving for constructing unstructured, all-hexahedral finite element meshes. Whisker weaving is based on the Spatial Twist Continuum {(STC)}, a global interpretation of the geometric dual of an all-hexahedral mesh. Whisker weaving begins with a closed, all-quadrilateral surface mesh bounding a solid geometry, then constructs hexahedral element connectivity advancing into the solid. The result of the whisker weaving algorithm is a complete representation of hex mesh connectivity only: Actual mesh node locations are determined afterwards.

The basic step of whisker weaving is to form a hexahedral element by crossing or intersecting dual entities. This operation, combined with seaming or joining operations in dual space, is sufficient to mesh simple block problems. When meshing more complex geometries, certain other dual entities appear such as blind chords, merged sheets, and self-intersecting chords. Occasionally specific types of invalid connectivity arise. These are detected by a general method based on repeated {STC} edges. This leads into a strategy for resolving some cases of invalidities immediately.

The whisker weaving implementation has so far been successful at generating meshes for simple block-type geometries and for some non-block geometries. Mesh sizes are currently limited to a few hundred elements. While the size and complexity of meshes generated by whisker weaving are currently limited, the algorithm shows promise for extension to much more general problems.},

	abstract = {We present a deep-subwavelength-size metal slot-waveguide structure which can efficiently propagate surface plasmon polaritons {(SPPs)} at 1.55 mum within a high-index material. Through a systematic design analysis, we investigate the intrinsic tradeoffs and suggest solutions to substantially increase the propagation length of {SPPs} combining high-index dielectrics and metal structures. By studying several metal/dielectric geometries, we have found that the slot-waveguide size can be significantly decreased by the use of high-index materials without compromising the overall propagation losses. Our analysis also indicates that the device size-scaling is ultimately limited by a cutoff thickness for the metal film in which the slot is defined. For film thicknesses below cutoff, radiation modes exist which leak out of the guiding region. For certain operating frequencies, the radiant energy leaks out into both free space modes as well as surface plasmons guided along the top/bottom metal surfaces of the device. We have shown that, by using a silicon filling, the cutoff thickness of a 100-nm-wide slot waveguide can be as small as 90 nm, compared with 750 nm for the unfilled reference structures. In addition, we have demonstrated that by the use of {SiO2} gap regions surrounding the Si dielectric core in a 200times400-nm silver slot region (partially filled metal slot), we can considerably reduce the overall propagation losses to less than 0.14 {dB/mum}, corresponding to a propagation length of approximately 50 mum},

	abstract = {We present a new approach for the generation of hexahedral finite element meshes for solid bodies in computer-aided design. The key idea is to use a purely combinatorial method, namely a shelling process, to decompose a topological ball with a prescribed surface mesh into combinatorial cubes, so-called hexahedra. The shelling corresponds to a series of graph transformations on the surface mesh which is guided by the cycle structure of the combinatorial dual. Our method transforms the graph of the surface mesh iteratively by changing the dual cycle structure until we get the surface mesh of a single hexahedron. Starting with a single hexahedron and reversing the order of the graph transformations, each transformation step can be interpreted as adding one or more hexahedra to the so far created hex complex.

Given an arbitrary solid body, we first decompose it into simpler subdomains equivalent to topological balls by adding virtual 2-manifolds. Second, we determine a compatible quadrilateral surface mesh for all created subdomains. Then, in the main part we can use the shelling of topological balls to build up a hex complex for each subdomain independently. Finally, the combinatorial mesh(es) are embedded into the given solids and smoothed to improve quality.},

 equations gives a theoretically elegant and computationally efficient way of describing small imperfections and weak interactions in electro-magnetic systems.

In this paper we developed a novel coupled mode and perturbation theory formulations for treating generic non-uniform (varying along the direction of propagation) perturbations of a waveguide cross-section based on Hamiltonian formulation of Maxwell equations in curvilinear coordinates. We show that our formulation is accurate and rapidly converges to an exact result when used in a coupled mode theory framework even for the high index-contrast discontinuous dielectric profiles. Among others, our formulation allows for an efficient numerical evaluation of induced {PMD} due to a generic distortion of a waveguide profile, analysis of mode filters, mode converters and other optical elements such as strong Bragg gratings, tapers, bends etc., and arbitrary combinations of thereof. To our knowledge, this is the first time perturbation and coupled mode theories are developed to deal with arbitrary non-uniform profile variations in high index-contrast waveguides.},

Although low-density induced coherent oscillations have been observed in semiconductor absorbers11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, coherent pulse propagation phenomena in active semiconductor devices have not been observed.

The scalable fabrication capabilities for this earth-abundant, environmentally friendly material are unmatched in sophistication and can be unleashed to realize a plethora of high-performance photonic functionalities that find application in information, bio-, display, camouflage, ornamental, and energy technologies. Nanofashioning represents a general strategy to turn Si into a useful optical material and Si structures have already been engineered to enable light emission, optical cloaking, waveguiding, nonlinear optics, enhanced light absorption, and sensing. Here, we demonstrate that a wide spectrum of colors can be generated by harnessing the strong resonant light scattering properties of Si nanostructures under white light illumination. The ability to engineer such colors in a predetermined fashion through a choice of the structure size, dielectric environment, and illumination conditions opens up entirely new applications of Si and puts this material in a new light.},

The search is on for high-performance antennas that offer facile integration on chips. Here we demonstrate a new, easily fabricated optical antenna design that achieves an unprecedented level of control over fluorescent emission by combining concepts from plasmonics, radiative decay engineering and optical beaming. The antenna consists of a nanoscale plasmonic cavity filled with quantum dots coupled to a miniature grating structure that can be engineered to produce one or more highly collimated beams. Electromagnetic simulations and confocal microscopy were used to visualize the beaming process. The metals defining the plasmonic cavity can be utilized to electrically control the emission intensity and wavelength. These findings facilitate the realization of a new class of active optical antennas for use in new optical sources and a wide range of nanoscale optical spectroscopy applications.},

Therefore, the development of the versatile and high-quality automatic hexahedral mesh generator for models consisting hexahedral and cylindrical objects in the same model is strongly desired. In the proposed generation method, where the geometrical change of the model is employed, the generated mesh is composed mainly of well-shaped hexahedral elements.

In order to determine a correct electron spectrum, the pointing angle of an electron beam incident on the spectrometer should be exactly defined. Here, we present a method for absolutely calibrating the electron spectrum by monitoring the pointing angle using a scintillating screen installed in front of a permanent dipole magnet. The ambiguous electron energy due to the pointing instability is corrected by the numerical and analytical calculations based on the relativistic equation of electron motion. It is also possible to estimate the energy spread of the electron beam and determine the energy resolution of the spectrometer using the beam divergence angle that is simultaneously measured on the screen. The calibration method with direct measurement of the spatial profile of an incident electron beam has a simple experimental layout and presents the full range of spatial and spectral information of the electron beams with energies of multi-hundred {MeV} level, despite the limited energy resolution of the simple electron spectrometer.},

A nonlinear scaling between the resonant wavelength and the antenna length has been found and quantitatively confirmed by full-field electromagnetic simulations. The resonant wavelength increases linearly with antenna length for small lengths and tends to saturate for large ones (length {\textgreater}4 μm). This saturation effect is attributed to the coupling of a geometrical antenna resonance and an absorption resonance of the substrate material.},

Harnessing these powerful physical effects relies on an ability to design and fashion structures at length scales comparable to the wavelength of electrons (∼1 nm) or photons (∼1 μm). Unfortunately, many practical optoelectronic devices exhibit intermediate sizes where resonant enhancement effects seem to be insignificant. Here, we show that leaky-mode resonances, which can gently confine light within subwavelength, high-refractive-index semiconductor nanostructures, are ideally suited to enhance and spectrally engineer light absorption in this important size regime. This is illustrated with a series of individual germa nium nanowire photodetectors. This notion, together with the ever-increasing control over nanostructure synthesis opens up tremendous opportunities for the realization of a wide range of ligh-performance, nanowire-based optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, photodetectors, optical modulators and light sources.},

We also look at the Multiple Multipole Program {(MMP)}, the Method of Auxiliary Sources {(MAS)}, and the Mesh-less Boundary Integral Equation {(BIE)} method from the family of boundary-discretization methods. We quantitatively compare several results generated from each method to make some conclusions about their applicability and accuracy for plasmonic simulations. Domain-discretization methods {(FEM} and {FDTD)} can reach a high level of accuracy only with a high discretization. This is affordable on modern computer hardware in {2D.} Recommendations for improving this are provided. The boundary-discretization techniques have a clear advantage in terms of speed, matrix size, and accuracy in {2D.} This advantage may disappear in the full {3D} analysis of geometrically complicated structures. This happens because matrices become denser or more ill-conditioned. Therefore the most efficient method depends on the problem dimension and complexity.},

	abstract = {The problem of path-finding in commercial computer games has to be solved in real time, often under constraints of limited memory and {CPU} resources. The computational effort required to find a path, using a search algorithm such as A*, increases with size of the search space. Hence, pathfinding on large maps can result in serious performance bottlenecks. This paper presents {HPA} * {(Hierarchical} Path-Finding A*), a hierarchical approach for reducing problem complexity in path-finding on grid-based maps. This technique abstracts a map into linked local clusters. At the local level, the optimal distances for crossing each cluster are pre-computed and cached. At the global level, clusters are traversed in a single big step. A hierarchy can be extended to more than two levels. Small clusters are grouped together to form larger clusters. Computing crossing distances for a large cluster uses distances computed for the smaller contained clusters. Our method is automatic and does not depend on a specific topology. Both random and real-game maps are successfully handled using no domainspecific knowledge. Our problem decomposition approach works very well in domains with a dynamically changing environment. The technique also has the advantage of simplicity and is easy to implement. If desired, more sophisticated, domain-specific algorithms can be plugged in for increased performance. The experimental results show a great reduction of the search effort. Compared to a highly-optimized A*, {HPA} * is shown to be up to 10 times faster, while finding paths that are within 1 \% of optimal. 1 1},

The ellipsometric data have been analyzed using an electronic model based on critical points of zero dimension, i.e., an exciton model. The optical constants of thin-film samples on spectrosil B substrates have been deduced and are used to characterize the waveguiding conditions in these asymmetric slab structures. The exciton model that we have used leads to a small correlation of the parameters and accurate fits. The good match with normal-incidence transmission spectrophotometry data and surface profilometry determinations of thickness gives further confidence in the suitability of this model. Based on our measurements, we calculate the cut-off thicknesses for the fundamental {TE-guided} modes in our silica-polymer-air structures to lie within the range of 40 nm to 70 nm (depending on the specific polymer), and demonstrate corresponding confinement factors {(Gamma)} between 37 \% and 63 \%. The calculated thickness dependence of the cut-off wavelength agrees well with experimental data for the thickness dependence of the peak amplified spontaneous emission {(ASE)} wavelength and is, therefore, consistent with previous explanations of the {ASE} spectral shifts.},

The anticrossing allows one to create highly localized energy distributions in finite arrays that can be tuned via the illumination wavelength.

	abstract = {Excessive memory use may cause severe performance problems and system crashes. Without appropriate tools, it may be difficult or impossible to determine why a program is using too much memory. This applies even though Python provides automatic memory management - garbage collection can help avoid many memory allocation bugs, but only to a certain extent due to the lack of information during program execution. There is still a need for tools helping the programmer to understand the memory behaviour of programs, especially in complicated situations. The primary motivation for Heapy is that there has been a lack
of such tools for Python.

The main questions addressed by Heapy are how much memory is used by objects, what are the objects of most interest for optimization purposes, and why are objects kept in memory. Memory leaks are often of special interest and may be found by comparing snapshots of the heap population taken at different times. Memory profiles, using different kinds of classifiers
that may include retainer information, can provide quick overviews revealing optimization possibilities not thought of beforehand. Reference patterns and shortest reference paths provide different perspectives of object access patterns to help explain why objects are kept in memory.},

Light trapping is particularly critical in such thin-film crystalline silicon solar cells in order to increase light absorption and hence cell efficiency. In this article we investigate the suitability of localized surface plasmons on silver nanoparticles for enhancing the absorbance of silicon solar cells. We find that surface plasmons can increase the spectral response of thin-film cells over almost the entire solar spectrum. At wavelengths close to the band gap of Si we observe a significant enhancement of the absorption for both thin-film and wafer-based structures. We report a sevenfold enhancement for wafer-based cells at λ = 1200 nm and up to 16-fold enhancement at λ = 1050 nm for 1.25 μm thin silicon-on-insulator {(SOI)} cells, and compare the results with a theoretical dipole-waveguide model. We also report a close to 12-fold enhancement in the electroluminescence from ultrathin {SOI} light-emitting diodes and investigate the effect of varying the particle size on that enhancement.},

The nonlinear refractive index of the waveguide layer experiences an abrupt change of the local pump field owing to this bistability effect.

The coupling of high quality factor {(Q)} dielectric and semiconductor microresonators is by now well-understood and chipscale applications are abound. The coupling behavior of low-Q nanometallic structures has also been exploited to realize high-performance plasmonic devices and metamaterials. Although dense arrays of semiconductor nanoparticles and nanowires {(NWs)} find increasing use in optoelectronic devices, their photonic coupling has remained largely unexplored. These high refractive index nano-objects can serve as low-Q optical antennas that can effectively receive and broadcast light. We demonstrate that the broad band antenna response of a pair of {NWs} can be tuned significantly by engineering their optical coupling and develop an intuitive coupled-mode theory to explain our observations.},

In addition to their 'receiving' properties, optical antennas can operate in 'broadcasting' mode, and have been used to modify the emission rate and direction of individual molecules. In these applications the antenna must operate at frequencies given by existing light emitters. Using thermal excitation of optical antennas, we bypass this limitation and realize emitters at infrared frequencies where sources are less readily available. Specifically, we show that the thermal emission from a single {SiC} whisker antenna is attributable to well-defined, size-tunable Mie resonances. Furthermore, we derive a fundamental limit on the antenna emittance and argue theoretically that these structures are nearly ideal black-body antennas. Combined with advancing progress in antenna design, these results could lead to optical antenna emitters operating throughout the infrared frequency range.},

This work presents an efficient and accurate method to construct the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices directly from correlation functions for several types of propagators. Emphasis is placed on a recurrence relationship between the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. This method is similar to, but more efficient than, several existing methods.

ploited to switch the signal by shifting the microsphere resonance.
A resonance wavelength shift of 5 pm, sufficient to fully switch
the signal, was observed with a pump pulse energy of only 85 {nJ.}
The rise time of the switch was ∼25 ms (limited by the pump
peak power) and its fall time was ∼30 ms (limited by the sphere’s
thermal time constant). The product of the switching peak power

Central to this effort is the development of ultracompact, silicon-compatible, and functional optoelectronic devices. Photodetectors play a key role as interfaces between photonics and electronics but are plagued by a fundamental efficiency−speed trade-off. Moreover, engineering of desired wavelength and polarization sensitivities typically requires construction of space-consuming components. Here, we demonstrate how to overcome these limitations in a nanoscale metal−semiconductor−metal germanium photodetector for the optical communications band. The detector capitalizes on antenna effects to dramatically enhance the photoresponse ({\textgreater}25-fold) and to enable wavelength and polarization selectivity. The electrical design featuring asymmetric metallic contacts also enables ultralow dark currents (20 {pA)}, low power consumption, and high-speed operation ({\textgreater}100 {GHz).} The presented high-performance photodetection scheme represents a significant step toward realizing integrated on-chip communication and manifests a new paradigm for developing miniaturized optoelectronics components.},

Microcavity resonator based narrow-linewidth light sources were designed and modeled using the 3-D full-wave finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} method of solving Maxwell’s equations. The microcavity confines light to a small modal volume by resonant recirculation in a structure with low roundtrip optical loss. The resonators were formed in close proximity to waveguides used for evanescent-wave coupling of light out of the microcavity. Waveguides using Si-nanocrystals in {SiO2} are difficult to couple to planar microdisks because the mode extends deep into the oxide, whereas simulations show that microresonators using {SiNx} can. The coupling efficiency between the resonator and the single-mode waveguides was optimized by varying the gap size and the waveguide width and thickness. Luminescence from silicon nanoparticles in both {SiO2} and {SiNx} films was studied. Process optimization for forming Si nanoparticles in {SiO2} or {SiNx} including the effects of hydrogen annealing and the preparation of {SiNx} films with excess Si by various techniques {(CVD} and Si ion implantation) was performed. High-index-contrast microcavity resonators were fabricated using {SiNx} on {SiO2} with silicon nanoparticles and imaged using atomic force microscopy. The structures include microdisk and microring cavities doped with silicon nanoparticles with and without erbium.},

We show how it is possible to solve for interior eigenvalues, such as localized defect modes, without computing the many underlying eigenstates. Preconditioned conjugate-gradient Rayleigh-quotient minimization is compared with the Davidson method for eigensolution, and a number of iteration variants and preconditioners are characterized.

It is demonstrated that only dipole-type surface plasmons can be excited by a homogeneous dynamical electric field. The Lorentz friction due to irradiation of electromagnetic energy by plasmon oscillations is analyzed with respect to sphere dimension. The resulting shift in resonance frequency due to plasmon damping is compared with experimental data for various sphere radii.

We show that excitation of any of these sub-radiant modes results in the most efficient energy transfer throughout the optical spectrum, with smaller interparticle separations resulting in the longest propagation.},

	abstract = {A finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} method based on a regular Cartesian Yee's lattice is developed for calculating the dispersion band diagram of a 2-D photonic crystal. Unlike methods that require auxiliary difference equations or nonorthogonal grid schemes, our method uses the standard central-difference equations and can be easily implemented in a parallel computing environment. The application of the periodic boundary condition on an angled boundary involves a split-field formulation of Maxwell's equations. We show that the method can be applied for photonic crystals of both orthogonal and nonorthogonal unit cells. Complete and accurate bandgap information is obtained by using this {FDTD} approach. Numerical results for 2-D {TE/TM} modes in triangular lattice photonic crystals are in excellent agreement with the results from 2-D plane wave expansion method. For a triangular lattice photonic crystal slab, the dispersion relation is calculated by a 3-D {FDTD} method similarly formulated. The result agrees well with the 3-D finite-element method solution. The calculations also show that the 2-D simulation using an effective index approximation can result in considerable error for higher bands.},

The applied strain changes the peak wavelength of the birefringent interferometer connecting with the {EDF}, which can make it possible to discriminate concurrent sensitivities like temperature and strain.

In particular, we investigate the spectral, far-field and near-field optical properties of metal nanoparticle arrays generated according to simple deterministic sequences characterized by fractal Fourier spectra. Additionally, we will consider the case of flat Fourier-transform sequences, which reproduce the behavior of purely random systems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Based on the coupled dipole approach {(CDA)} and finite difference time domain {(FDTD)} simulations, we study the radiative (long-range) and quasi-static (short-range) electromagnetic coupling in deterministic aperiodic plasmon arrays of metal nanoparticles. In addition, we investigate the local field enhancement and the enhancement scaling in periodic and aperiodic arrays with increasing degree of complexity. We believe that the accurate control of electromagnetic coupling and sub-wavelength field enhancement in deterministic aperiodic environments will enable novel nanodevice applications in areas such as field-enhanced nanosensors, engineered {SERS} substrates and optical nano-antenna arrays.},

	abstract = {The concept of a nanowire solar cell with photon-harvesting shells is presented. In this architecture, organic molecules which absorb strongly in the near infrared where silicon absorbs weakly are coupled to silicon nanowires {(SiNWs).} This enables an array of 7-μm-long nanowires with a diameter of 50 nm to absorb over 85\% of the photons above the bandgap of silicon. The organic molecules are bonded to the surface of the {SiNWs} forming a thin shell. They absorb the low-energy photons and subsequently transfer the energy to the {SiNWs} via Förster resonant energy transfer, creating free electrons and holes within the {SiNWs.} The carriers are then separated at a radial p-n junction in a nanowire and extracted at the respective electrodes. The shortness of the nanowires is expected to lower the dark current due to the decrease in p-n junction surface area, which scales linearly with wire length. The theoretical power conversion efficiency is 15\%. To demonstrate this concept, we measure a 60\% increase in photocurrent from a planar silicon-on-insulator diode when a 5 nm layer of poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene is applied to the surface of the silicon. This increase is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.},

However, recent papers have raised some doubts concerning the fact that its use may not be as effective when dealing with strongly anisotropic and noncanonical geometries. Our goal here is to extend the plasmonic cloaking technique to irregular obstacles and to show that proper cloak design may provide a significant and uniform scattering reduction, independent of angle of incidence, position, and polarization of the illumination. We investigate how the volumetric effect of scattering cancellation provided by plasmonic media may drastically suppress the scattering for these irregular geometries independent of the illumination angle, and we shed some light on the physical mechanisms and the design rules at the basis of this cloaking technique when applied to objects whose scattering properties are dependent upon polarization and angle of incidence.},

Near spaced metal nanoparticles constitute a resonant waveguide which can transfer plasmon-polariton whose mode size is below the diffraction limit of light. To find the adequate parameters of this waveguide, cautious analysis has been performed from a single nanoparticle which consists of noble metals, to the periodic array which consists of these particles. For the more realistic analysis, a series of simulations were performed using the finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} method with the parameters from the analytical investigation. The last part of this thesis deals with parallel implementation of the {FDTD} method for dispersive media. The dispersive metals are modeled, using the modified {FDTD} algorithm based on the Drude model. The practical limits of the memory space and computing power required by the three dimensional {FDTD} analysis are resolved through the parallel implementation.},

The dynamic changes of optical properties R and α, distributions of laser heat density, electron and lattice temperature, and phase changes of a copper film were investigated. Comparing with the experimental data of average absorption showed that the proposed two-temperature model together with the critical point model can simulate satisfying results for temperature-dependent R and α.

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new technique which calculates the reflection coefficient for the plane wave incident on planar periodic structures. The method referred to as spectral finite-difference time-domain {(SFDTD)} replaces the conventional single-angle incident wave, with a constant transverse wavenumber {(CTW)} wave. Because the transverse wavenumbers are constant, the fields have no delay in the transverse plane (x-y plane), and {PBC} (periodic boundary condition) can be directly implemented in the time domain for both oblique and normal incident waves. The stability criterion for this new {FDTD} technique is angle-independent and therefore this method works well for incident angles close to grazing (θ=90°) as well as normal incident (θ=0°). This shows the efficiency of the method compared to other available {FDTD} techniques for the same purpose that force a more restricted stability criterion as angles turns to grazing. The validity of this method is verified by comparing the reflection coefficient calculated by this method with the analytical results of a grounded slab. The results of this technique are also compared with method of moments for a periodic array of metallic patches and a good agreement is observed. A periodic array of metallic patches above a {PEC} plate is analyzed and the reflection coefficient is calculated over a wide frequency band for angles varying from 0° to close to 90°.},

To solve this problem, an extensible compiler, simplified wrapper and interface generator {(SWIG)}, has been developed to automate the task of integrating compiled code with scripting language interpreters. {SWIG} requires no modifications to existing code and uses existing source to create bindings for nine different target languages including Python, Perl, Tcl, Ruby, Guile, and Java. By automating language integration, {SWIG} enables scientists to use scripting languages at all stages of software development and allows existing software to be more easily integrated into a scripting environment. Although {SWIG} has been in use for more than 6 years, little has been published on its design and the underlying mechanisms that make it work. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to cover these topics.},

This topology supports plasmon excitations with frequencies that are sensitively dependent on the relative radii of the nanoparticle’s core and shell. The plasmon linewidth for this geometry is typically quite broad, nominally 100 nm or more in wavelength at plasmon resonance wavelengths in the near infrared. Several distinct physical mechanisms control the plasmon lineshape: phase retardation effects, including multipolar plasmon contributions; inhomogeneous broadening due to core and shell size distributions; and electron scattering at the shell interfaces. These mechanisms are examined in terms of their relative contributions to the plasmon line shape for nanoshells fabricated with diameters of 100–250 nm.},

In contrast to the previously studied structures, the gap between the slabs and the metal stripe and the associated field enhancement effect result in the dramatically modified modal behavior. It is shown that, under optimized configurations, the transmission loss can be reduced significantly with little change in the mode confinement capability compared to similar dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton waveguides. Studies on the crosstalk between adjacent such hybrid waveguides reveal the ability to increase the integration density by {\textasciitilde}60 times compared with the traditional {IMI} structures when used in {3D} photonic circuits.

These studies demonstrate that the propagation of light along surface plasmon waveguides is mediated by a discrete number of guided polariton modes as well as a continuum of radiation modes. To distinguish the contribution of the guided modes from that of the radiation continuum, a parametric study of propagation length as a function of varying stripe width is performed. Discontinuities consistent with the loss of a guided mode are observed near cutoff widths predicted by numerical simulations, and a severe decrease in propagation length is observed below cutoff for the fundamental surface plasmon mode. Contrary to previous interpretations, experimental and numerical investigations confirm that the finite propagation lengths observed along the narrowest stripes are in good agreement with an intuitive model for the radiation continuum. Furthermore, multimode interference studies provide direct evidence for multiple guided modes and support previous findings with regard to modal cutoff.},

	abstract = {We consider propagation of surface plasmon polaritons {(SPPs)} in linear periodic chains {(LPCs)} of prolate and oblate metallic spheroids. We show that the {SPP} group velocity can be efficiently controlled by varying the aspect ratio of the spheroids. For sufficiently small aspect ratios, a gap appears in the first Brillouin zone of the chain lattice in which propagating modes do not exist. Depending on the {SPP} polarization, the gap extends to certain intervals of the Bloch wave number q. Thus, for transverse polarization, no propagating {SPPs} exist with wave numbers q such that qc⊥{\textless}{\textbar}q{\textbar}{\textless}π/h, h being the chain period. For longitudinally polarized {SPPs}, the gap spans the interval {\textbar}q{\textbar}{\textless}qc∥. Here qc⊥ and qc∥ are different constants, which depend on the chain parameters, spheroid aspect ratio, and its orientation with respect to the chain axis. The dependence of the dispersion curves on the spheroid aspect ratio leads to a number of interesting effects. In particular, bandwidth of {SPPs} that can propagate in an {LPC} can be substantially increased by utilizing prolate or oblate spheroids. When q is close to a critical value, so that {\textbar}q−qc⊥{\textbar}⪡π/h or {\textbar}q−qc∥{\textbar}⪡π/h, the decay length of the {SPPs} is dramatically increased. In addition, the dispersion curves acquire a very large positive or negative slope. This can be used to achieve superluminal group velocity for realistic chain parameters. We demonstrate superluminal propagation of Gaussian wave packets in numerical simulations. Both theory and simulations are based on Maxwell equations with account of retardation and, therefore, are fully relativistic.},

	abstract = {The {FullWAVE} simulation engine is a part of the {RSoft} Photonic Suite, and is based on the well-
known finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} technique. It calculates the electromagnetic field as a function of time and space in a given index structure in response to a given electromagnetic excitation. {FullWAVE} is ideal for studying the propagation of light in a wide variety of photonic structures.

As a member of the {RSoft} Photonics Suite, {FullWAVE} is designed to work with {RSoft’s} other passive device simulation modules. This modular approach to the design and simulation of photonic devices is one of {RSoft’s} Photonic Suite’s greatest strengths. Each program in the suite is designed to “play nice”with the other programs, creating an environment in which data can be shared between the modules. Virtually all the input and output files are in a simple {ASCII} text format, which allows even greater user control over program operation as well as third-party programs to be integrated into the suite.

While the {RSoft} Photonics Suite is designed to be used via the {GUI} {(Graphical} User Interface), command line operation is also possible. This, coupled with the modularity of the Suite, allows for complex scripting capability. The Suite is not limited to a single scripting language, but rather uses the native scripting language of your operating system. For example, Windows users can use {DOS} batch files, while Linux users can use bash scripts. Additionally, users familiar with languages such as Perl, Python, C, or C++ can create custom scripts in these languages. The {RSoft} Photonics Suite provides the best of both worlds: it allows for simulations to be performed via the {GUI}, and for complicated
custom simulations to be performed via a script. New and advanced users alike are able to realize the full power of the Suite.},

In particular, the underlying coordinate-stretching idea behind {PML} breaks down in photonic crystals and in other structures where the material is not an analytic function in the direction perpendicular to the boundary, leading to substantial reflections. The alternative is an adiabatic absorber, in which reflections are made negligible by gradually increasing the material absorption at the boundaries, similar to a common strategy to combat discretization reflections in {PMLs.} We demonstrate the fundamental connection between such reflections and the smoothness of the absorption profile via coupled-mode theory, and show how to obtain higher-order and even exponential vanishing of the reflection with absorber thickness.},

Although the physical properties can already be demonstrated in two-dimensional {(2D)} metamaterials, the practical applications require {3D} bulk-like structures. This prerequisite has been achieved in the gigahertz range for microwave applications owing to the ease of fabrication by simply stacking printed circuit boards. In the optical domain, such an elegant method has been the missing building block towards the realization of {3D} metamaterials. Here, we present a general method to manufacture {3D} optical (infrared) metamaterials using a layer-by-layer technique.

Their importance is reflected in the tireless efforts that have been devoted to improving the electrical and structural properties of {PV} materials. More recently, photon management {(PM)} has emerged as a powerful additional means to boost energy conversion efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate an entirely new {PM} strategy that capitalizes on strong broad band optical antenna effects in one-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures to dramatically enhance absorption of sunlight. We show that the absorption of sunlight in Si nanowires {(Si} {NWs)} can be significantly enhanced over the bulk. The {NW’s} optical properties also naturally give rise to an improved angular response. We propose that by patterning the silicon layer in a thin film {PV} cell into an array of {NWs}, one can boost the absorption for solar radiation by 25\% while utilizing less than half of the semiconductor material (250\% increase in the light absorption per unit volume of material). These results significantly advance our understanding of the way sunlight is absorbed by one-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures and provide a clear, intuitive guidance for the design of efficient {NW} solar cells. The presented approach is universal to any semiconductor and a wide range of nanostructures; as such, it provides a new {PV} platform technology.},

	abstract = {We show that Maxwell’s equations for a nonmagnetic, isotropic, but electrically inhomogeneous medium in the absence of charges or current sources lead to a wave equation governing surface electromagnetic wave propagation along a general curved, smooth surface which, when recasted using an appropriate choice of curvilinear coordinates u1,u2,u3, can be fully separated in the spatial dimensions. It is shown that surface electromagnetic wave solutions decay exponentially away from the surface (along the u3 coordinate) with the same decay rate independent of the shape of the surface. Transmission and reflection coefficients governing scattering of electromagnetic waves on a varying surface shape are derived. Two test cases of a Gaussian-shaped and a sinusoidal-shaped surface are solved in details and discussed numerically in terms of transmission and reflection coefficients including dependencies on surface-shape parameters in the wavelength range 250–750 nm. The present method for determining surface electromagnetic wave propagation along complex-shaped metal-dielectric surfaces allows better insight into the importance of surface geometry as well as considerably faster computational speeds than those provided by standard numerical methods.},

Mesh enhancement is the process in which an existing mesh is modified to better meet the requirements of the physics application. To provide the reader with sufficient background information, seven of the nine chapters contain a summary of the numerical simulation process, basic background on mesh terminology and generation approaches, computational geometry, discretization of differential equations, methods of solving linear and nonlinear algebraic systems, geometry of surfaces in Euclidean space, and general elliptic methods for mesh enhancement. Furthermore, these chapters use the concept of harmonic coordinates to develop a unifying framework, the Laplace-Beltrami system, which is the governing principle of the book. The final two chapters apply this scheme, along with other selected elliptic methods, to various structured and unstructured example problems.},

Our results, using a realistic model for silver at optical wavelengths, show that good right-angle bending transmission can be achieved for wavelengths λ{\textgreater} 600 nm. An approximate stop-band at lower wavelengths also occurs, which can be partly understood in terms of a dispersion curve analysis. The bending efficiency is shown to correlate with a focusing effect at the inner bend corner. Finally, we show that good bending transmission can even arise out of U-turn structures.},

The modified time-domain Maxwell's equations for dispersive media are expressed in terms of coordinate-stretching variables. We extend the recursive convolution {(RC)} and piecewise linear recursive convolution {(PLRC)} approaches to arbitrary dispersive media in a more general form. The algorithm is tested for homogeneous and inhomogeneous media with three typical kinds of dispersive media, i.e., Lorentz medium, unmagnetized plasma, and Debye medium. Excellent agreement between the {FDTD} results and analytical solutions is obtained for all testing cases with both {RC} and {PLRC} approaches. We demonstrate the applications of the algorithm with several examples in subsurface radar detection of mine-like objects, cylinders, and spheres buried in a dispersive half-space and the mapping of a curved interface. Because of their generality, the algorithm and computer program can be used to model biological materials, artificial dielectrics, optical materials, and other dispersive media},

In the proposed method, one first uses the {FD-TD} method to compute the near total fields within a rectangular volume which fully encloses the object. Then, an electromagnetic-field equivalence principle is invoked at a virtual surface of this rectangular volume to transform the tangential near scattered fields to the far field. To verify the feasibility of this method, the surface currents, near scattered fields, far scattered fields, and radar cross section of two canonical two-dimensional objects are presented. For these cases, it is shown that the {FD-TD} method provides magnitude of current and field predictions which are within Â± 2.5 percent and further phase values within Â± 30 of values predicted by the method of moments ( {MOM)} at virtually every point including in shadow regions.},

Two algorithmic approaches are outlined for incorporating dispersion into the {FDTD} time-stepping equations. The first employs a frequency-dependent complex permittivity (denoted Form-1), and the second employs a frequency-dependent complex conductivity (denoted Form-2). A Pade representation is used in Z-transform space to represent the frequency-dependent permittivity {(Form-1)} or conductivity {(Form-2).} This is a generalization over several previous methods employing either Debye, Lorentz, or Drude models. The coefficients of the Pade model may be obtained through an optimization process, leading directly to a finite-difference representation of the dispersion relation, without introducing discretization error. Stability criteria for the dispersive {FDTD} algorithms are given. We show that several previously developed dispersive {FDTD} algorithms can be cast as special cases of our more general framework.

Propagating modes are excited with tightly focused ultrashort laser pulses that are shaped in amplitude, phase, and polarization (ellipticity and orientation angle). We decouple the interplay between two main mechanisms which are essential for the control of local near-fields. First, the amplitudes and the phase difference of two laser pulse polarization components are used to guide linear flux to a desired spatial position. Second, temporal compression of the near-field at the target location is achieved using the remaining free laser pulse parameter to flatten the local spectral phase. The resulting enhancement of nonlinear signals from this intuitive analytic two-step process is compared to and confirmed by the results of an iterative adaptive learning loop in which an evolutionary algorithm performs a global optimization. Thus, we gain detailed insight into why a certain complex laser pulse shape leads to a particular control target. This analytic approach may also be useful in a number of other coherent control scenarios.},

	abstract = {{BandSOLVE} is a fully integrated {CAD} tool and simulation engine for generating and analyzing photonic band structures. The simulation engine is based on an advanced optimized implementation of the plane-wave expansion technique for periodic structures. {BandSOLVE} is ideal for producing band structures for classic photonic bandgap structures such as {2D} and {3D} photonic crystal waveguides, defect sites. In addition it can be applied to fiber structures such as photonic crystal fibers and photonic bandgap fibers, which are particularly challenging for other simulation techniques.

{BandSOLVE} is designed to function with and complement {RSoft’s} other photonic simulation tools including {BeamPROP} and {FullWAVE.} It shares the same {CAD} tool and existing users familiar with the {BeamPROP} {CAD} interface can begin working with {BandSOLVE} with essentially no additional effort. In particular, {BandSOLVE} is especially useful for optimizing the band structure properties of photonic crystals, which are subsequently simulated in {FullWAVE} to examine time-dependent properties such as waveguide loss and coupling. This manual provides detailed guidance as to the complementary roles of the design tools and when it is appropriate to use a particular tool.

Note that to use {BandSOLVE} effectively, it is critical to have a working knowledge of the {RSoft} Photonics Suite {CAD} interface. The {CAD} tool is described in full in the accompanying {CAD} manual. The reader is strongly encouraged to study the layout tutorials in the {CAD} manual before reading beyond Chapter 3 of this manual.},

A buffer layer is inserted on an octree core mesh to improve the mesh quality significantly. Laplacian-like smoothing, angle-based smoothing and local optimization-based untangling methods are used with certain restrictions to further improve the mesh quality. Several examples are shown to demonstrate the capability of our hexahedral mesh generation method for complex geometries. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} method is used to obtain numerical solutions without resorting to frequency-domain analysis and Fourier transformation. For the application of {FDTD} method to the oblique incidence case, Maxwell's equations are transformed such that the computational domain can be truncated by using periodic boundary conditions. The {FDTD} method is then used to solve the transformed equations. In solving the transformed equations by the {FDTD} method, the absorbing boundary conditions are modified and the eigenvalues of the system are determined for the stability analysis. The final results are obtained by using the inverse transformation. Since the transformation is very simple, the computational time is primarily determined by the {FDTD} solution of the transformed equations. The theoretical results are illustrated by calculating the scattered fields in the computational domain as a function of time for a pulse incident at an oblique angle. The time domain results are also transformed into frequency domain and compared with the results obtained using a standard frequency domain technique.},

The technique, which derives from Bayes' theorem on conditional probabilities, conserves the constraints on frequency distributions (i.e., normalization and non-negativeness) and, at each iteration, increases the likelihood of the observed sample. The behavior of the technique is explored by applying it to problems whose solutions are known in the limit of infinite sample size, and excellent results are obtained after a few iterations. The astronomical use of the technique is illustrated by applying it to the problem of rectifying distributions of v sin i for aspect effect; calculations are also reported illustrating the technique's possible use for correcting radio-astronomical observations for beam-smoothing. Application tot he problem of obtaining unbiased, smoothed histograms is also suggested.},

We implemented the parallel finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} method using the parallel environment based on clusters. Especially, this implementation targets the simulation of a plasmon waveguide which attracts interest as one of the candidates for a photonic integrated circuit. For this purpose, the Yee algorithm is modified to treat a dispersive material and implemented based on the three dimensional special parallelism. This implementation had been validated through various test simulations, and we checked the performance enhancement by the parallel environment. The parallel implementation of the {FDTD} developed through this work produced the same results as the previous works and shows the calculation speed increase proportional to the number of calculation nodes. Finally, we describe the limitation of this implementation and the possible solutions},

The general algorithm for an arbitrarily shaped grating is described, and convergence of the solution is proven. The techniques with first-, second-, and third-order smoothing procedures are applied to the problem of a sinusoidal grating. Consequently it is made clear that a higher-order smoothing procedure provides a more effective means for evaluating the diffracted field than a lower-order procedure.

Calculations for cylinders with irregular cross section, coupled structures, and periodic gratings are shown. These systems exhibit a resonant behavior with complex field distribution and strong field enhancement, and therefore their computation requires a very accurate numerical method. It is shown that the multiple multipole {(MMP)} method, together with an automatic multipole setting {(AMS)} procedure, is well suited for these computations. An {AMS} technique for the two-dimensional {MMP} method is presented. It relies on the global topology of each domain boundary to generate a distribution of numerically independent multipole expansions. This technique greatly facilitates the {MMP} modeling.},

	abstract = {Principles of Optics is one of the classic science books of the twentieth century, and probably the most influential book in optics published in the past 40 years. The new edition is the first ever thoroughly revised and expanded edition of this standard text. Among the new material, much of which is not available in any other optics text, is a section on the {CAT} scan (computerized axial tomography), which has revolutionized medical diagnostics. The book also includes a new chapter on scattering from inhomogeneous media which provides a comprehensive treatment of the theory of scattering of scalar as well as of electromagnetic waves, including the Born series and the Rytov series. The chapter also presents an account of the principles of diffraction tomography - a refinement of the {CAT} scan - to which Emil Wolf, one of the authors, has made a basic contribution by formulating in 1969 what is generally regarded to be the basic theorem in this field. The chapter also includes an account of scattering from periodic potentials and its connection to the classic subject of determining the structure of crystals from X-ray diffraction experiments, including accounts of von Laue equations, Bragg's law, the Ewald sphere of reflection and the Ewald limiting sphere, both generalized to continuous media. These topics, although originally introduced in connection with the theory of X-ray diffraction by crystals, have since become of considerable relevance to optics, for example in connection with deep holograms. Other new topics covered in this new edition include interference with broad-band light, which introduces the reader to an important phenomenon discovered relatively recently by Emil Wolf, namely the generation of shifts of spectral lines and other modifications of spectra of radiated fields due to the state of coherence of a source. There is also a section on the so-called Rayleigh-Sommerfield diffraction theory which, in recent times, has been finding increasing popularity among optical scientists. There are also several new appendices, including one on energy conservation in scalar wavefields, which is seldom discussed in books on optics. The new edition of this standard reference will continue to be invaluable to advanced undergraduates, graduate students and researchers working in most areas of optics.},

	abstract = {Finite-difference time-domain {(FDTD)} simulations of any electromagnetic problem require truncation of an often-unbounded physical region by an electromagnetically bounded region by deploying an artificial construct known as the perfectly matched layer {(PML).} As it is not possible to construct a universal {PML} that is non-reflective for different materials, {PMLs} that are tailored to a specific problem are required. For example, depending on the number of dispersive materials being truncated at the boundaries of a simulation region, an {FDTD} code may contain multiple sets of update equations for {PML} implementations. However, such an approach is prone to introducing coding errors. It also makes it extremely difficult to maintain and upgrade an existing {FDTD} code. In this paper, we solve this problem by developing a new, unified {PML} algorithm that can effectively truncate all types of linearly dispersive materials. The unification of the algorithm is achieved by employing a general form of the medium permittivity that includes three types of dielectric response functions, known as the Debye, Lorentz, and Drude response functions, as particular cases. We demonstrate the versatility and flexibility of the new
formulation by implementing a single {FDTD} code to simulate absorption of electromagnetic pulse inside a medium that is adjacent to dispersive materials described by different dispersion models. The proposed algorithm can also be used for simulations of optical phenomena in metamaterials and materials exhibiting negative refractive indices.},

Of course, for users who are familiar with such a text-based interface, shell environment through the web is also provided by virtual network computing technology. Our architecture is composed of 6 layers, and each layer has several components. This 6-layered architecture provides interoperability and flexibility between the components.

	abstract = {Sorting and hashing are two completely different concepts in computer science, and appear mutually exclusive to one another. Hashing is a search method using the data as a key to map to the location within memory, and is used for rapid storage and retrieval. Sorting is a process of organizing data from a random permutation into an ordered arrangement, and is a common activity performed frequently in a variety of applications. Almost all conventional sorting algorithms work by comparison, and in doing so have a linearithmic greatest lower bound on the algorithmic time complexity. Any improvement in the theoretical time complexity of a sorting algorithm can result in overall larger gains in implementation performance.. A gain in algorithmic performance leads to much larger gains in speed for the application that uses the sort algorithm. Such a sort algorithm needs to use an alternative method for ordering the data than comparison, to exceed the linearithmic time complexity boundary on algorithmic performance. The hash sort is a general purpose non-comparison based sorting algorithm by hashing, which has some interesting features not found in conventional sorting algorithms. The hash sort asymptotically outperforms the fastest traditional sorting algorithm, the quick sort. The hash sort algorithm has a linear time complexity factor -- even in the worst case. The hash sort opens an area for further work and investigation into alternative means of sorting.},

In this paper, we present a comparative study of {SPP} modes corresponding to the two types of complex solutions for an infinitely long {LCMN} embedded in a gain medium. We show that even though gain predominantly affects the {SPP} dispersion obtained with real frequency, both solutions result in the same dispersion and attenuation of {SPP} modes, when Ohmic losses are almost compensated by gain. In this regime, an analytic expression for the propagation length of {SPPs} exists, and the {SPPs’} dispersion is determined by a real equation. We also demonstrate that for a given amount of gain (below the amplification limit of {\textasciitilde}1000 cm-1), transversely polarized {SPPs} attenuate slower than longitudinally polarized {SPPs} and are, therefore, preferable for the purpose of energy transfer in gain-supplied {LCMNs.} The transmission windows for {SPP} modes of different polarizations do not overlap each other, which facilitates realization of {LCMN-based} plasmonic filters.

At the same time, it was already well established that tiny metallic particles have a number of valuable optical properties that are derived from their ability to support collective light-induced electronic excitations, known as surface plasmons. Most notably, nanostructured metals dramatically alter the way light scatters from molecules, and this later led to the development of an important optical spectroscopy technique called surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.},

The method, referred to here as the convolutional {PML} {(CPML)}, offers a number of advantages over the traditional implementations of the {PML.} Specifically, the application of the {CPML} is completely independent of the host medium. Thus, no modifications are necessary when applying it to inhomogeneous, lossy, anisotropic, dispersive, or nonlinear media. Secondly, it is shown that the {CFS-PML} is highly absorptive of evanescent modes and can provide significant memory savings when computing the wave interaction of elongated structures, sharp corners, or low-frequency excitations.},

Thanks to two resonator dots, the plasmon frontal impact is avoided by transmission of the two plasmons from the input guide to an output one. The resonator and guide dots are identical in size and metal composition. The dipole–dipole interactions are restricted to first nearest neighbors. A convenient metal doping is assumed to compensate exactly all attenuations. The parameters are the nearest neighbor distances between the dots. These distances are rescaled to the chain nearest neighbor distance d. The system has two symmetry mirror planes. This simple model enables us to obtain two analytic tuning relations for the plasmon cross transmission. The intensities of the transmitted signals versus kd, where k is the plasmon propagation vector, are also given.},

Dramatic reduction of the light group velocity—and even bringing light pulses to a complete halt—has been demonstrated recently in various atomic2, 3, 4, 5 and solid state systems6, 7, 8, where the material absorption is cancelled via quantum optical coherent effects3, 4, 5, 7. Exploitation of slow light phenomena has potential for applications ranging from all-optical storage to all-optical switching9, 10. Existing schemes, however, are restricted to the narrow frequency range of the material resonance, which limits the operation frequency, maximum data rate and storage capacity10. Moreover, the implementation of external lasers, low pressures and/or low temperatures prevents miniaturization and hinders practical applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate an over 300-fold reduction of the group velocity on a silicon chip via an ultra-compact photonic integrated circuit using low-loss silicon photonic crystal waveguides11, 12 that can support an optical mode with a submicrometre cross-section13, 14.

By considering a sharp boundary as a limit of anisotropically smoothed systems, we are able to derive a correct first-order perturbation theory and mode-coupling constants, involving only surface integrals of the unperturbed fields over the perturbed interface.

Particularly, a new algorithm to minimize memory requirement is presented. Additionally, the proposed formulations are derived to be fully independent of the material properties of the {FDTD} computational domain.

	abstract = {Quicksort is the preferred in-place sorting algorithm in many contexts, since its average computing time on uniformly distributed inputs is {\&THgr;(N} log N), and it is in fact faster than most other sorting algorithms on most inputs. Its drawback is that its worst-case time bound is {\&THgr;(N2).} Previous attempts to protect against the worst case by improving the way quicksort chooses pivot elements for partitioning have increased the average computing time too much - one might as well use heapsort, which has a {\&THgr;(N} log N) worst-case time bound, but is on the average 2-5 times slower than quicksort. A similar dilemma exists with selection algorithms (for finding the i-th largest element) based on partitioning. This paper describes a simple solution to this dilemma: limit the depth of partitioning, and for subproblems that exceed the limit switch to another algorithm with a better worst-case bound. Using heapsort as the lsquostopperrsquo yields a sorting algorithm that is just as fast as quicksort in the average case, but also has an {\&THgr;(N} log N) worst case time bound. For selection, a hybrid of Hoare's {FIND} algorithm, which is linear on average but quadratic in the worst case, and the Blum-Floyd-Pratt-Rivest-Tarjan algorithm is as fast as Hoare's algorithm in practice, yet has a linear worst-case time bound. Also discussed are issues of implementing the new algorithms as generic algorithms, and accurately measuring their performance in the framework of the C+:+ Standard Template Library. ©1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

It is shown that because it is based on the field teleportation principle of {[M.E.} Watts et al., February-March 2003], this {rRBC} generates exact negative copies of the outgoing time-domain fields in {FDTD}, independently of the angle of incidence, polarization, field impedance, or material properties. The effect of the {rRBC} is to differentiate the outgoing signal and reduce it approximately by a factor of 10 in the time domain. Several {rRBC} boundaries can be stacked, one after the other, to continually decrease the level of the outgoing signal. Termination of the {rRBC} stack with a one cell Huygen's condition further reduces the signal, and minimizes the integration feedback as the faint echoes cross backwards through the {rRBCs.} It is shown that the net result is a boundary that is more efficient than a {PML} of similar total thickness (especially at shallow angles of incidence) and is trivial to program, requiring no special treatment for corners or material properties.},

The superperiodic design employs a periodic arrangement of defective missing holes on an otherwise perfect periodic pattern of holes for the basic two-dimensional {PhC} structure. Avoiding the fragile semiconductor membrane structure that is popular in current {PhC} laser designs, the design utilizes a thick epitaxy structure with electromagnetic density-of-mode singularity. This singularity is created by the defect mode in a three-dimensional frequency versus wave vector relation within the band matched with the gain spectrum of the {LED} that is placed on top of the base reflector plate material. The superperiodic structure of this design is shown to provide an effective means for sharpening the vertical beam in the far field, based on discrete-Fourier transformation theory. Subsequent simulations based on the finite-difference time-domain analysis verify the effectiveness of the design principle on {GaN} epitaxy structures with various bottom layers.},

Maxwell's equations are solved for any arbitrary cluster geometry and for any light (polarized or not) incidence by usual expansion of the various fields. Usual boundary conditions are used but take into account the possible existence of plasmons in the spheres. High-order multipolar (electric and magnetic) interaction effects are included. The problem is cast into the calculation of the microscopic effective dielectric and magnetic susceptibility for the spheres, and that of the appropriate interaction terms. The latter (which constitute the hardest part of the theory in general) are calculated by formulating in a very practical way a recurrence relation for spherical vector wave functions in different reference frames. The extinction cross section is derived for any arbitrary case in order to allow for comparison of experimental data and previous theoretical work. The theory in the absence of any high-order polar effect is applied to the case of metallic clusters, e.g., small sodium spheres. Effects due to size distribution, sphere separation, and sphere magnetic permittivity are analyzed. Different light incidences are considered. A very brief discussion of the experimental status is presented for the case of metallic spheres. New experiments are suggested for which the theory is easily read out. Appendices contain new relations between Legendre functions and "spherical coupling parameters" allowing one to treat up to (24,24) polar-order interactions.},

The spontaneous emission of an emitter placed in such a metal nanogap is expected to be strongly modified due to coupling to gap plasmons. We investigate the light emission properties of semiconductor quantum dots {(QD)} in a metal nanoslit, which is a truncated {MDM} waveguide. More specifically, we measure both the lifetime and the state of polarization of the out-coupled {QD} emission from a metal nanoslit. We observe clear lifetime and polarization changes of {QD} emission. As the slit width gets smaller, the {QD} exciton lifetime gradually decreases, and its emission becomes polarized normal to the slit, as expected for gap plasmon coupled light emission. We also find that the polarization of the collected {QD} emission is flipped (i.e., becomes parallel to a slit) when the excited emitters are located just outside the slit. We have conducted dipole emission calculations in metal nanoslits, and these explain the experimentally observed lifetime and polarization changes well. These findings may have novel applications in nanoscale optical sources, sensors, and active devices.},

Since the {PM-PCF} is composed of a single material, such as silica, the peak wavelength shift with temperature variation can be negligible because of the small amount of the birefringence change of the {PM-PCF} with temperature change. The measured temperature sensitivity is −0.3 {pm/°C.} However, the peak wavelength can be changed by strain because the peak wavelength shift is directly proportion to strain change. The strain sensitivity is measured to be 1.3 pm/με in a strain range from 0 to 1600 με. The measurement resolution of the strain is estimated to be 2.1 με. The proposed scheme has advantages of simple structure and low loss without a Sagnac loop, temperature insensitivity, ease installation, and short length of a sensing probe compared with a conventional {PMF-based} Sagnac loop interferometer.},

For sufficiently small particles (kd≪1, where k is the wave vector and d is the interparticle separation), the calculation is exact. The lowest bands differ only slightly from previous point-dipole calculations provided the particle radius a≲d/3, but differ substantially at smaller separation. We also calculate the dispersion relations for many higher bands, and estimate the group velocity vg and the exponential decay length {ξD} for energy propagation for the lowest two bands due to single-grain damping. For a/d=0.33, the result for {ξD} is in qualitative agreement with experiments on gold nanoparticle chains, while for smaller separation, such as a/d=0.45, vg and {ξD} are expected to be strongly k dependent because of the multipole corrections. When the particles touch, we predict percolation effects in the spectrum, and find surprising symmetry in the plasmon band structure. Finally, we reformulate the band-structure equations for a Drude metal in the time domain, and suggest how to include localized driving electric fields in the equations of motion.},

Paving[1] has proven reliable for quadrilateral meshing on arbitrary surfaces.

Unconstrained Plastering attempts to leverage the benefits of Paving and Plastering, without the over-constrained nature of Plastering. Unconstrained Plastering uses advancing fronts to inwardly project unconstrained hexahedral layers from an unmeshed boundary. Only when three layers cross, is a hex element formed. Resolving the final voids is easier since closely spaced, randomly oriented quadrilaterals do not over-constrain the problem. Implementation has begun on Unconstrained Plastering, however, proof of its reliability is still forthcoming},

There has been considerable advancement in {FDTD} computational technology over the past few years, and this new edition brings you the very latest details with four new invited chapters on advanced techniques for {PSTD}, unconditional stability, provably stable {FDTD-FETD} hybrids, and hardware acceleration. Moreover, you find many completely new sections throughout the book, including major updates on convolutional {PML} {ABCs;} dispersive, nonlinear, classical-gain, and quantum-gain materials; and micro-, nano-, and bio- photonics.

This single resource provides complete guidance on {FDTD} techniques and applications, from basic concepts, to the current state-of-the-art. It enables you to more efficiently and effectively design and analyze key electronics and photonics technologies, including wireless communications devices, high-speed digital and microwave circuits, and integrated optics. You find sample {FDTD} codes written in Matlab® that serve as a self-guided refresher, and examples of how to use the {FDTD} method on a wide range of projects in the field. What’s more, to supplement the third edition, the authors and publisher have created a Website where you can find solutions to the problems, sample {FDTD} {PML} codes, text updates/errata, and downloadable color graphics and videos. Consequently, this new edition is the ideal textbook for both a senior-year undergraduate elective course and a graduate course in computational electrodynamics.},

This paper announces that checkers is now solved: Perfect play by both sides leads to a draw. This is the most challenging popular game to be solved to date, roughly one million times as complex as Connect Four. Artificial intelligence technology has been used to generate strong heuristic-based game-playing programs, such as Deep Blue for chess. Solving a game takes this to the next level by replacing the heuristics with perfection.},

For fields which are traveling obliquely to the grid axes, there is no simple way to account fully for the effects of the inherent numerical artifacts associated with plane-wave propagation in the {FDTD} grid. Failure to account for these artifacts causes erroneous fields to leak across the {TFSF} boundary. Recent publications have proposed ways to use the dispersion relation to describe precisely plane-wave propagation in the {FDTD} grid thus permitting the realization of a nearly perfect {TFSF} boundary. However, these publications did not cover certain implementations details (such as the type of Fourier transform which is needed) or their scope was so broad as to mask the relative simplicity with which the approach can be applied to problems involving planar interfaces. This work considers the Fourier transforms needed in order for the implementation to be exact. Reflection and transmission coefficients for a planar interface are derived. Implementation for planar perfect electric conductors is also presented},

However, it is demonstrated that, through simple field transformations, a new set of fields can be introduced so that they obey Maxwell's equations for an anisotropic medium with properly chosen constitutive parameters depending on the local radii of curvature. The formulation presented here recovers, as particular cases, the previously proposed Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical {PMLs.} A previously employed anisotropic (quasi-) {PML} for conformal terminations is shown to be the large radius of curvature approximation of the anisotropic conformal {PML} derived herein.},

	abstract = {The optical constants n and k were obtained for the noble metals (copper, silver, and gold) from reflection and transmission measurements on vacuum-evaporated thin films at room temperature, in the spectral range 0.5-6.5 {eV.} The film-thickness range was 185-500 Å. Three optical measurements were inverted to obtain the film thickness d as well as n and k. The estimated error in d was ± 2 Å, and that in n, k was less than 0.02 over most of the spectral range. The results in the film-thickness range 250-500 Å were independent of thickness, and were unchanged after vacuum annealing or aging in air. The free-electron optical effective masses and relaxation times derived from the results in the near infrared agree satisfactorily with previous values. The interband contribution to the imaginary part of the dielectric constant was obtained by subtracting the free-electron contribution. Some recent theoretical calculations are compared with the results for copper and gold. In addition, some other recent experiments are critically compared with our results.},

	abstract = {Usually, investigators in materials science have asked: {“What} properties does a certain new material or structure have?” Now, the inverse problem arises: {“I} want to achieve certain—possibly unheard-of—material properties. How should the corresponding micro- or nanostructure look?” Examples could be: efficiently blocking acoustic noise due to a highway from a nearby village by a tailored wall, concentrating electromagnetic energy into as-tight-as-possible spaces, or avoiding reflections from a material's surface. The underlying common scheme is wave physics. Material properties that were otherwise unachievable, e.g., negative refraction and cloaking, may eventually be designed into optical metamaterials and photonic crystals. Both require tailoring of the properties (i.e., phase velocity and impedance) of an electromagnetic wave moving through the substance at the local level. In photonic crystals, the phase velocity of an electromagnetic wave moving through the crystal is controlled by tuning the photonic band structure; the impedance is determined by the electromagnetic field distributions throughout the material. In metamaterials, this amounts to tailoring the effective electric permittivity and magnetic permeability. In either case, introducing resonances is the key to controlling the local wave properties. The recent development of advanced fabrication techniques being applied to metamaterials and photonic crystals may lead to realization of such designer materials.},

	abstract = {Harmonic inversion is introduced as a powerful tool for both the analysis of quantum spectra and semiclassical periodic orbit quantization. The method allows one to circumvent the uncertainty principle of the conventional Fourier transform and to extract dynamical information from quantum spectra which has been unattainable before, such as bifurcations of orbits, the uncovering of hidden ghost orbits in complex phase space, and the direct observation of symmetry breaking effects. The method also solves the fundamental convergence problems in semiclassical periodic orbit theories - for both the Berry-Tabor formula and Gutzwiller's trace formula - and can therefore be applied as a novel technique for periodic orbit quantization, i.e., to calculate semiclassical eigenenergies from afinite set of classical periodic orbits. The advantage of periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion is the universality and wide applicability of the method, which will be demonstrated in this work for various open and bound systems with underlying regular, chaotic, and even mixed classical dynamics. The efficiency of the method is increased, i.e., the number of orbits required for periodic orbit quantization is reduced, when the harmonic inversion technique is generalized to the analysis of cross-correlated periodic orbit sums. The method provides not only the eigenenergies and resonances of systems but also allows the semiclassical calculation of diagonal matrix elements and, e.g., for atoms in external fields, individual non-diagonal transition strengths. Furthermore, it is possible to include higher-order terms of the {[Plancks} over 2pi] expanded periodic orbit sum to obtain semiclassical spectra beyond the Gutzwiller and Berry-Tabor approximation.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that the transmission properties of surface plasmon-polaritons {(SPPs)} across a rectangular groove in a metallic film can be described by an analytical model that treats the groove as a side-coupled cavity to propagating {SPPs} on the metal surface. The coupling efficiency to the groove is quantified by treating it as a truncated metal-dielectric-metal {(MDM)} waveguide. Finite-difference frequency-domain {(FDFD)} simulations and mode orthogonality relations are employed to derive the basic scattering coefficients that describe the interaction between the relevant modes in the system. The modeled {SPP} transmission and reflection intensities show excellent agreement with full-field simulations over a wide range of groove dimensions, validating this intuitive model. The model predicts the sharp transmission minima that occur whenever an incident {SPP} resonantly couples to the groove. We also for the first time show the importance of evanescent, reactive {MDM} {SPP} modes to the transmission behavior. {SPPs} that couple to this mode are resonantly enhanced upon reflection from the bottom of the groove, leading to high field intensities and sharp transmission minima across the groove. The resonant behavior exhibited by the grooves has a number of important device applications, including {SPP} mirrors, filters, and modulators.},

Indefinite media with hyperbolic dispersion, in particular, have found intriguing applications. The miniaturization of optical cavities increases the photon density of states and therefore enhances light–matter interactions for applications in modern optoelectronics. However, scaling down the optical cavity is limited to the diffraction limit and by the reduced quality factor. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an optical cavity made of indefinite metamaterials that confines the electromagnetic field to an extremely small space. The experiments reveal that indefinite cavities demonstrate anomalous scaling laws: cavities with different sizes can resonant at the same frequency, and a higher-order resonance mode oscillates at a lower frequency. We also demonstrate a universal fourth power law for the radiation quality factor of the wave vector. Cavities with sizes down to λ/12 are realized with ultrahigh optical indices (up to 17.4), a feature that is critically important for many applications.},

We also show that the net distance traveled by the domain wall is exactly proportional to the current pulse length because of the lag derived from its acceleration at the onset of the pulse. Thus, independent of its inertia, a domain wall can be accurately positioned using properly timed current pulses.},

	abstract = {In a previous paper we developed a method, Filter-Diagonalization, for extracting eigenvalues and eigenstates of a given operator at any desired energy range. In essence, the method eliminates correlation between distant eigenstates through a short-time filter while correlations between closely lying states are eliminated by diagonalization. Here we extend Filter-Diagonalization. When used to extract eigenvalues for a given operator H, we show that all eigenvalue information is directly extracted from a short segment of the correlation function C(t)=(psi(0){\textbar}{\textbar}{e−iHt{\textbar}{\textbar}psi(0))}, or alternately from a small number of residues (psi(0){\textbar}{\textbar}{Rn(H){\textbar}{\textbar}psi(0))}, where psi(0) is a random initial function and {Rn(H)} is any desired polynomial expansion in H. The implications of this feature are twofold. First, in contrast to the previous version the wave packet needs only to be propagated once (to prepare C(t)), and eigenstates at all desired energy windows can then be extracted with negligible extra computation time (and negligible storage requirements). In a simulation presented here, accurate eigenvalues are extracted using propagation times which are only a 0.0041 fraction of the ``natural'' time, i.e., the time by which the relative phase of the two closest eigenstates reaches 2pi. The second and more important feature is that the method is automatically suitable for extracting eigenvalues (or normal modes) using a short-time segment of any signal C(t) which is a sum of (unknown) Fourier components {(C(t)=[summation]$_{\textrm{ndne}}$$^{\textrm{} - i epsilon[sub nt]}}$) regardless of its origin. In addition to its use for determining eigenvalues of known operators, the method may also be utilized to extract normal modes from classical-dynamics simulations, eigenstates from real-time Quantum Monte-Carlo studies, frequencies from experimental optical or electrical signals, or be utilized in any other circumstance where a correlation function or general signal is only known for short times (or expensive to generate at long times).},

The photonic structure vs intensity behaviour was investigated for a few systems consisting of periodically layered structures covered with an optically nonlinear material. Theoretical estimations of the logical gate parameters were made for linear {2D} Si-{SiO2} , Si-air and Ge-Se photonic crystals covered with the nonlinear doped glass. It was shown that the beam angular-frequency diagrams contain extremely sensitive areas inside the total reflection range, where the weak nonlinearity leads to dramatic change in light reflection and transmission. Two principal schemes of all-optical logical devices were analyzed and possible applications in all-optical adders and logical gates were discussed.},

To decrease the fabrication difficulty, large air holes are adopted. Furthermore, the chromatic dispersion of the fiber is not sensitive to the structure parameters. So the proposed fiber structure can greatly facilitate fiber drawing and can be used for broadband dispersion compensation.},

This paper has shown that a second order accurate scheme can be obtained with the recursive convolution approach without abandoning the assumption of piecewise constant fields over each time step. This new formulation yields an algorithm with the same memory requirements and computational speed as the original {RC} method of Luebbers et al. (1990). Comparisons with the dispersion errors of piecewise linear recursive convolution and the auxiliary equation methods of Young et al. (1995) and Joseph et al.
